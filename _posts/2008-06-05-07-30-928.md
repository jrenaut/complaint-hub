[![Running for cover](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3050/2552763790_93568a6ac1_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/2552763790/)The Nationals game was rained out last night, so I didn't get to see Albert Pujols. It was fun anyway - we wandered around the stadium, stopped at Ben's Chili Bowl, and then came home. I actually saw someone wearing a McGwire shirt. I'm kind of surprised - I thought he was pretty much disgraced and forgotten. I mean, he was my favorite player growing up, and I wouldn't wear a McGwire shirt. There was also a tiny girl in an Eckstein jersey, probably about the size of Eckstein himself. I'd guess she weighed about 95 pounds. I almost took a picture of her to send to [Fire Joe Morgan](http://www.firejoemorgan.com), but then I thought she might not appreciate it. Edit to add: They're making up the game today at 1, which doesn't really work for my schedule, but Pujols isn't playing. I don't really mind missing a game between the awful Nationals and the Pujols-free Cardinals. Edit again to add: Pujols pinch hit in the 7th and hit one out in a [4-1 Cardinals win](http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=280605220). Now I'm annoyed. I should have gone to the game.
