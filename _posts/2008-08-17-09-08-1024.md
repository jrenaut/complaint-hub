A friend and I met our wives at [Commonwealth](http://commonwealthgastropub.com/) last night. It had been girls night - they met up in Arlington and had dinner. So the guys went to the Nationals game to watch the Rockies pummel the Nationals, I still haven't seen a Nationals win in the new stadium. Anyway, since the wife is 37 weeks pregnant now, she got to choose the location, and she chose one near us. It was a beautiful night, so we sat outside. This means I didn't really get a feel for the inside, but maybe we can do that next time. They were serving from their pub menu since it was late. We got an order of fries, which I didn't actually try, but the table consensus was positive. They are large chunks of potato, so if that's the way you like your fries, you're in luck. And we tried the [Scotch eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_egg), which were very good. And the service was good. I think my only complaint was the lack of any sort of description on the menu. We thought at first it was just the pub menu that didn't have descriptions, but they brought us what I assumed was the regular menu, as well, because it had the drinks, and it didn't have descriptions, either. Since there is a ton of stuff on the menu that's a bit out of the ordinary, at least for this side of the pond, it seems that maybe descriptions on the menu would be nice. But if that's the biggest complaint from a self-proclaimed complainer, I think the trip was a resounding success. I'm sure we'll be back - my father-in-law has already been informed that there is a bar with outdoor seating and [bubble and squeak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_and_squeak) on the menu, so it would take the intervention of the health department or some equally powerful entity to keep us from revisiting Commonwealth next time he comes down to visit.
