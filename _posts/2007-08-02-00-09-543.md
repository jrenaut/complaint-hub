Or maybe it's new heights. I guess that depends on your point of view. I've been doing a little fooling around with some C++ with [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/). I'm doing a little baseball simulating, and it's going well. If it continues to go well, I'll eventually have a little executable that generates pages and pages of wonderful statistics that I can do all sorts of wonderful things with.

I realize I'm in a very small minority with my obsession with baseball statistics, but those of us here (And by 'here', I mean 'In the crazy minority') are really into it. The wife doesn't really understand, but as long as I don't sit here writing code and ignoring her while she's talking, I think she'll humor me.

I'm a little disappointed with [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org), however. It was slow, error messages were unhelpful, and code completion was iffy. And since code completion is one of the greatest things about an [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), its absence is kind of a deal breaker.  It may be partly a function of my crappy computer, though.

So I'm currently coding in [Gedit](http://www.gnome.org/projects/gedit/) and doing command-line compiling. It's fine so far, but I haven't done anything really complicated.

Anyway, it's fun.
