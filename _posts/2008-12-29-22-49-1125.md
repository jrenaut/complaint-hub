Wow. 44-6. Two fumbles and an interception. He went 1-3 in December, although the one win was a good one at home against the Giants. Check out his [splits](http://www.nfl.com/players/tonyromo/gamesplits?id=ROM787981) at NFL.com. His December stats are completely out of whack with other months, and this happens _every year_. He's been in the league long enough that this is statistically significant. He just can't play in December. It doesn't look like he's going to fix this. I'm feeling pretty good about the playoffs. There are only two teams in the playoffs that I loathe (The Giants, led by colossally-overrated-and-much-less-talented-than-his-brother Eli Manning, and the Panthers, picked every year by "experts" to win the Super Bowl despite the fact that they always suck and always will). Then there are the Dolphins and the Cardinals (Best potential Super Bowl matchup ever) to root for. And there's the potential for a Ravens-Steelers AFC Championship game, which would be a great game. Should be a fun playoff. And I'm sure Tony Romo will enjoy watching from a comfortable recliner.
