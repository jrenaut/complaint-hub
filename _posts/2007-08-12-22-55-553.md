I booted up Windows today for the first time in a while. Firefox is not working in Ubuntu. I mean, it is, sort of, but it hangs constantly, and it's driving me insane. I imagine I broke something, but it's a little strange that it only seems to be a problem in Firefox.

I'm hoping it's just a problem with Wubi running on this piece of junk computer. I want a new computer with a full Ubuntu install.

Update:  I booted back into Ubuntu and started up Open Office, which is notoriously resource-hungry, figuring that I could determine if it were simply a Firefox problem.  It's not.  Open Office never opened.  I waited a few minutes and then killed it.  I think I need to find a career that doesn't involve computers.  I seem to break every one I touch.
