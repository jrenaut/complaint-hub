And I thought I was just getting a lawyer when I got married.  Turns out my wife is an accountant, too.  When we were (Well, she was) doing our taxes, she discovered that I had failed to report some mortgage interest paid on my 2005 return.  So, she insisted that I re-file.  Or, rather, she re-filed, and made me sign it.

Today, I get a check from the IRS for $328.46.  $300 in taxes I paid and didn't owe, and $28.46 in interest.

So, what should I do with it?  I figure it should be something nice for both of us.
