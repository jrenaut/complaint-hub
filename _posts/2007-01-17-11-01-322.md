[The Average White Guy](http://www.theaveragewhiteguy.com/)

> I hope you find my blog to be well...average! If it's too good, expectations emerge. If it's not good enough, I'll be the only one reading it. So I figure: "Average".

I got a comment from this guy the other day, and I checked out his blog.  He and I have a lot in common, I think, but maybe I'm better at creative rationalization, so I haven't had to come to terms with my place in the world yet.  Maybe that makes me worse.

Anyway, I've been reading his stuff, and it's interesting.  He is a Yankees fan, so that's minus two points, but he said good things about Cal Ripken when he got into the Hall, so I guess I can give the two points back.
