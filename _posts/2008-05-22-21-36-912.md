We've gone through two pretty big baby milestones in the last few days. The most recent was our [Bradley Method class](http://www.bradleybirth.com/) that we just got back from. It was kind of long (<del>Two hours, and she ran over about 15 minutes</del> Two hours and fifteen minutes), but it sounds like it will be good stuff to know. There are 8 other couples in the class. Two of the mothers didn't make it to the first class, which seems pretty weird, but I'm sure they had their reasons. But birthing class doesn't really make this seem real to me. I mean, obviously it's real - the wife is showing, and I've felt the baby kicking, I've seen it hopping around on the sonogram. But it still seems like something that's forever in the future. But the other milestone really brings home the reality of the baby. The wife has started buying some baby clothes (She's getting a little addicted to Ebay and Freecycle, I think), and seeing these little onesies make the baby seem much more real to me than anything else. So, if you're a dad-to-be, and you're having a hard time getting your head around this, I recommend getting some baby clothes and just imagine putting them on your own kid. It's definitely working for me.
