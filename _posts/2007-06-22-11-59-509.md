I was just in the restroom at work, and a short, balding man came in.  He had made an attempt to hide the fact that he was balding by getting a really bad haircut and wearing an ugly shirt.  It didn't work.

He tried to fix his hair, then walked out.  It was all I could do to resist telling him not to bother.
