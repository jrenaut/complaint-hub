I need a new dry cleaner.  I just picked up five shirts.  The total was $7.13.   They wouldn't let me use a credit card, and I only had $5 in my wallet.  She said there's a $10 minimum on credit cards.  Is it just me, or is that pretty high?  I've heard of $5 minimums, but $10 seems steep.

Anyone know a good dry cleaner in Columbia Heights?  I've heard nothing but bad stories about Georgetown Valet and Oxxo or whatever they're called.
