[Striking writers in talks to launch Web start-ups - Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-webwriters17dec17%2C0%2C4998256%2Cfull.story)

> "It's in development and rapidly incubating," said Aaron Mendelsohn, a guild board member and co-creator of the "Air Bud" movies.

Shoot, you had me until "Air Bud".

Seriously, I think this is very cool.  If the writers can't get what they want from Hollywood, they should remind Hollywood that their monopoly on the distribution of video entertainment is taking a big hit from the internet.

It will be very interesting when some of these writers start making real money.  It will not only strengthen their position by making them more independent, but also by demonstrating the power of the internet as a revenue stream.  If the writers can go to the studio and say, "Look at all the money our work made online.  Now do you see why we want you to pay us when we do it for you?".

In the meantime, I eagerly await "Air Bud Online!"
