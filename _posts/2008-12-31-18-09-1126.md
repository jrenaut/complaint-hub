The Orioles finally let [Daniel Cabrera](http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/cabreda01.shtml) go. I have [posted](/node/910) at [length](/node/894) about his [ups and downs](/node/861). And now he's a National, so I can hop on the Metro go see him on occasion when we get a babysitter. He'll probably pull a [Schilling](http://www.baseball-reference.com/s/schilcu01.shtml) and turn into an All-Star. It's funny how Schilling pitched 44 of his 569 career games as an Oriole, yet I still always considered him an Oriole who happened to pitch for someone else. It is more likely, however, that his control will continue to ruin his gobs of talent, and he'll always be a 5.00 ERA guy who every once in while throws a two hit shutout and strikes out 10. I hope the Nationals enjoy him.
