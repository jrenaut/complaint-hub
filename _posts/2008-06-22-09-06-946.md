For those of you who read the site via the actual front page, rather than the RSS feed (Which, if Google Analytics and Feedburner are accurate and I'm reading the numbers correctly, is about 1/3 of you), do you ever look at "What I'm reading" on the right side of the page? These are things I've come across on my RSS feed that I find interesting, but don't really have anything to say about. I'm going to keep sharing things there regardless of who's reading, because I know at the very least, Mike looks at them on his Google Reader, and sharing them takes virtually no effort on my part. But I was curious if anyone looks at them, or has maybe found a site they didn't otherwise know about through them.
