According to the [Columbia Heights News Forum](http://columbiaheightsnews.org/forum/index.php), it's not looking good for a new grocery store in the [DC USA site](http://www.columbiaheightsnews.org/News/Retail-News/DC-USA.html). That's too bad. I was pulling for Whole Foods. Certainly we can make do with the one on P Street. But I hear on the forum that the new Giant and the local grocers are having a hard time keeping up with demand, and I do love Whole Foods' organic vegetables.

It looks like it's 1.6 miles from our house to Whole Foods. That's doable.
