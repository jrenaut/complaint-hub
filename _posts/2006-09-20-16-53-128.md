[CNN.com - Chavez calls Bush 'devil' in U.N. speech - Sep 20, 2006](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/09/20/chavez.un.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories)

This article scares me.  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is supposed to be a lunatic, but the article makes him sound like a mildly loopy Democrat.  Am I so tired of the stupid things our President does that the ravings of a madman start to sound normal?  Or is Chavez made out to be a little crazier than he really is by the media (Impossible!)?
