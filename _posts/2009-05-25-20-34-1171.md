I've been to three Nationals games this year. I went to the home opener against the Phillies, I went to see the Cardinals in my second failed attempt to watch Albert Pujols, and I went to the Orioles game because I'm actually a fan of the Orioles, despite Peter Angelos' attempts to the contrary. I just realized that [Adam Dunn](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dunnad01.shtml) might wish I came around more often. Not only are the Nats 2-1 in those three games, but Dunn is hitting .455 with four home runs and 11 RBIs. His [OPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging) is 2.175. Small sample size, sure, but I have yet to see him play a game in which he does not hit a home run, and he hit two against the Orioles, one a game-winning grand slam. If only I were a Nationals fan.
