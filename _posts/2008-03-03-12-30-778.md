[Linux Downloader for Amazon MP3 Store](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/03/linux-downloader-for.html)

> Amazon's launched a Linux-based downloader for its DRM-free MP3 music store -- fantastic news! Now if they'd only change the terms-of-service for the store to something sensible like "Don't do anything illegal with this music."

Well, this is pretty cool. Now I might actually USE the service. Up to now, you could buy single MP3s on whatever computer you wanted, but to get an album discount, you had to use Windows or Mac. A lot of good news from the music industry lately. I might actually give buying music a try again. I haven't bought or downloaded any music since I bought the last (disappointing) Cake cd a year or two ago.
