I posted a little while ago about my attempts to [optimize my blog for search engines](/blog/drupal-seo-and-you). I think it's working. Take this example. This morning, I linked to an article on [Prince of Petworth](http://www.princeofpetworth.com/?p=3452) about a new restaurant opening in Columbia Heights, [CommonWealth Gastropub](http://www.commonwealthgastropub.com/). Now, PoP is a near-deity in the greater Columbia Heights/Petworth/Logan/Shaw area. It's a good blog. I read it regularly. I, on the other hand, am a relative unknown who complains too much. PoP went to an early preview at CommonWealth and took pictures, then wrote an article about the experience. I linked to the article, and offered very limited commentary. Now, go do a little Google search for [commonwealth dc gastropub](http://www.google.com/search?q=commonwealth+dc+gastropub). you will notice that item seven is my post. The first item from PoP is item 23, and it's not even a link to the most recent article. So, on one hand, you have a good blog that did some real journalism. On the other, you have a blog, where half the readership was at the author's wedding, that just linked to the real journalism. But I show up first on Google.
