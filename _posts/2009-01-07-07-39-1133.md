More "as a result of you", but that's not such a snappy headline. As many of you may know, they have closed off a bunch of streets downtown until the Inauguration. I hear it's because Obama has moved into the area earlier than expected, so there wasn't a spot for him on the White House grounds. I don't know if this is the case, and don't really care. My problem is that they've interrupted the S2/S4 bus route, and I had to get off at 16th and K NW this morning. In the rain. And now my pants are soaking wet from the walk. And [WMATA](http://www.wmata.com) is no help - it took me 20 minutes last night to find any information about the detour beyond "there is a detour", and I still don't know what the next stop after 16th and K is. It's somewhere near 13th and H, I think, but I generally get off at the stop I know rather than hope that the next one is better. In any event, this is just one more reason that January 20th can't come soon enough.
