I don't really know much about the law surrounding this, so I have assume that the LPGA is within its legal rights to [require all members to speak English](http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=3553888). I mean, they have lawyers, and I imagine the lawyers approved this. But it sure doesn't sound that cool.

I can understand the LPGA's motivation. They are in the business of selling women's golf, and if their players can't communicate in the target market, it makes their job more difficult. I get that. But surely there's a way to increase the marketing appeal of the sport that's a little more tolerant. It would be interesting to see a once-in-a-lifetime golfer come through who doesn't speak English and refuses to learn. I bet the LPGA would back down before alienating a potential superstar.
