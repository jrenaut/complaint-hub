They just called the Senate race in Montana for Democrat Jon Tester.  So now control of the Senate rests with Virginia, and Jim Webb's 7000 vote lead.

Do you see now why I tell everyone to vote?  The difference between a Republican controlled Senate and a Democrat controlled senate is 7000 votes.  That's it.  I'm going to punch the next person who says his vote doesn't matter.  Yes, I meant to say 'his'.  I won't punch a girl.  I'll just glare at her sternly.  Perhaps waggle my finger.
