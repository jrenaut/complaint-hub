I'm just not enjoying [Script Frenzy](http://www.scriptfrenzy.org). The initial fun of using Celtx is wearing off, and I'm really not having a whole lot of fun.

I think part of it is that I only know two people doing it this year, and one has already quit. And I haven't paid much attention to the forums. And I'm a little behind, and going out of town this weekend, and that will put me even further behind.

The other thing is that doing this, and doing [Nanowrimo](http://www.nanowrimo.org), don't inspire me to take the next step. It was cooler when I thought, "Hey, I'll do this in a month, and then go on to write a whole novel, or a whole screenplay". But it seems pretty clear that isn't happening.

Maybe I'll take the story from this year's Script Frenzy, which is something I've been kicking around for years, and make it into a novel. Or maybe not.

Anyway, I haven't officially quit yet, but it's sure looking that way.
