Unless you live under a rock (or don't pay as much attention to gadget websites as I do), you probably know that TMobile is launching the first cell phone running Google's Android operating system today. This is what open-source techno-hippies like me wish the iPhone was. Instead of a closed, proprietary system controlled by one company that hates you, it's a totally open system, designed to run anything on any hardware, "controlled" by a company that loves making money (And only wants to own all your personal information in return). You won't see any exclusivity contracts from Google, so it's likely that Android will arrive on carriers that don't suck soon. It looks like work is not going to buy me a Blackberry (jerks), which may end up being good for me, as I'd rather have an Android phone. Suggestions for convincing the wife that I _need_ one are welcome. You will, however, see things like [the Amazon MP3 store pre-loaded](http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/amazon/archives/149389.asp?from=blog_last3). 

> Amazon.com said this morning that its MP3 music store will be pre-loaded on the T-Mobile G1, the first phone to be powered by Android.
