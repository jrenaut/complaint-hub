So a little while back, The Wife made some Old Bay roasted potatoes to go along with pancakes. Delicious. And then I got a little potato in my maple syrup, and it was even better. I love the flavor contrast. Then I got this book, [How to Cook Everything The Basics](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470528060/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=comphub08-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470528060)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=comphub08-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0470528060). It has a recipe for cheddar jalapeno biscuits that's pretty awesome, though a bit too buttery. I made those biscuits, and got the idea to do maple syrup Old Bay biscuits. [![Maple Syrup Old Bay Biscuits](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8362/8292225241_32e80341e7_n.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/8292225241/) After a good while, I finally found a basic biscuit recipe, subbed out some of the fat, and threw in some of my own ideas, and threw them in the oven. I love the result. Here's the recipe. 

## Maple Syrup Old Bay Biscuits

  * 2 cups of all purpose flour
  * 1 tablespoon baking powder
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * 1 tablespoon Old Bay
  * 2 tablespoons shortening
  * 8 tablespoons part skim ricotta cheese
  * 1/2 cup skim milk
  * 1 tablespoon maple syrup
Preheat the oven to 450. Mix the flour, baking powder, salt, and Old Bay in a big bowl. Mix in the shortening and ricotta with a fork until it looks like coarse crumbs. Add the maple syrup. Slowly pour in the milk while stirring, until it seems like dough. The recipe I followed says "until it pulls away from the bowl", but what does that really mean? Roll it in flour a bit until it's not sticky, then use a rolling pin to flatten it, about a half inch thick. Use a cookie cutter or something, then throw them on an ungreased pan. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until they brown a bit, and you have some awesome little biscuits.
