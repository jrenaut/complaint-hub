It was all Windows' fault.  Windows FTP seems to think that it shouldn't notify me if I'm overwriting a .htaccess file.  So I overwrote one, and killed Typo (The blogging engine that I use for From Harvard Street).  It's fixed now.

Also fixed - all the permalinks to Harvard Street posts now redirect to the corresponding pages at Complaint Hub.  So if you've linked to a post, the link still works, it just takes you to Complaint Hub instead.  I'm quite proud of myself.
