[Newsvine - Chertoff: U.S. Should Review Terror Laws](http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/08/13/323226-chertoff-us-should-review-terror-laws) - via [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/13/chertoff_lets_spy_on.html)

> "What helped the British in this case is the ability to be nimble, to be fast, to be flexible, to operate based on fast-moving information," [Chertoff] said. "We have to make sure our legal system allows us to do that. It's not like the 20th century, where you had time to get warrants."

And there you go. A wonderful quote from the guy in charge of making us safe. Who do you suppose is going to protect us from Homeland Security?
