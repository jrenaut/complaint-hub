[Two more shot on Girard Street last night](http://www.wjla.com/news/stories/0807/449994.html).  One died, one in the hospital.  I park on that street occasionally when our block is full, and it really doesn't seem that bad.  And there are frequently police cars around.

It kind of puts parking tickets in perspective, I guess.  I get pretty worked up over the city's campaign to make me sell my car, but at the same time, there are a lot more important things going on.
