A little while back my sister told me about [Map My Run](http://www.mapmyrun.com). It's a site integrated with Google Maps that lets you plot out your running route, and share routers with others. It's really cool in that you can add point by point to your route, so you can show how you turned left at that intersection and doubled back at the next one and all that. It also tells you how far you went, and lets you share a list of your public runs. [This is mine](http://profile.mapmyrun.com/jrenaut), so far. I did the "Up 29th in Woodley Park" run today. 29th is pretty rough.

So far there aren't a lot of runs mapped out in Columbia Heights and the surrounding area, but I'm going to do my part to change that. And now that I've told all of you, I'll be embarrassed if I don't.
