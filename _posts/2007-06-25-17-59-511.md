Yesterday, my wife fried the power supply to her month-old MacBook.  I think it happened when she unplugged it to move from the living room to the dining room.  Today, I went in to the Pentagon City Apple store, where we bought the computer last month, and talked with a salesman there.  He checked the power supply on a store computer, checked our computer on a store power supply, determined that our power supply was, indeed, dead, and promptly gave me a new one.  No questions, no nothing.  Just gave me a new one.

Then he walked me through the process for transferring files from the old computer to the new, which we tried once unsuccessfully.  I'm going to try it again tonight.

So, I may not like Apple and their over-priced proprietary hardware and their snooty commercials and the f'ing iPhone.  But I'm quite impressed with the service at this Apple store.  They were busy, too.  It's not like I caught a guy, bored in an empty store, and got a lot of attention.  And this will certainly be the first time an Apple has ever worked **better** after I touched it.
