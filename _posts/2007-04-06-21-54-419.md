So, the wife and I received a package today, USPS Priority Mail.  Inside was a catalog and gift card from [Home Decorators Collection](http://www.homedecorators.com/).  Noticeably absent from the package was any indication of who might have sent it.  The pleasant woman who answered the phone when I called them couldn't look it up without an order number, which wasn't included.

It looks like they have a bunch of nice stuff, so I'm looking forward to ordering something.  But I'd also like to thank the person or persons who sent us the card.  So, if it was you, let me know.
