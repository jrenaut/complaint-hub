[Episcopal Churches To Vote on Departure - washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/03/AR2006120301186.html?nav=rss_email/components)

Many Episcopal churches are voting very soon on whether or not to leave the umbrella of the U.S. Episcopal church because the U.S. church has allowed a gay bishop in New Hampshire.  I'm a little torn.  First, I fully support the right of a church to decide that they want to leave the organization because the organization did something they don't believe in.  But it's sad that two churches in Fairfax County, VA, where I live, are so upset over a gay bishop that they want to ally themselves with an African Reverend, [Peter Akinola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Akinola), who thinks holding hands with your gay partner in public should be punishable by jail time.

I assume that most people voting to leave will say that it's not just one gay bishop in a state most of them will never visit, but rather the direction the church is heading by allowing him to become a bishop, and that's certainly valid.

I wish some positive stuff about religion would make the news.  I know there are religious groups doing good things out there.  But the only ones that make the news are the intolerant ones.

I'm going to stop here, because I've lost my train of thought.
