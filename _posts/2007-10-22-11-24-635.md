Tomorrow, my seafood-and-vegetables-only-eating wife is going out to dinner with a friend.  I think I'm going to take this opportunity to cook some french fries and a large slab of red meat for myself.  Not that she opposes me eating red meat and I have to do it while she's not home, but it seems silly to cook two dinners.

Anyway, I'm not sure how to prepare it.  I think we have some four-year-old steak seasoning in the cupboard.  But that's not really exciting.  What's an interesting and not too complicated way to prepare a steak?  My cooking skill level is a bit above average, I think.  I can follow a recipe, and I can do a little experimentation outside of a recipe, but I'm never going to be on tv for my cooking skills.
