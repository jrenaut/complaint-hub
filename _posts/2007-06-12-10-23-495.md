The [disaster magnet](http://blog.complainthub.com/?p=482) once again worked its magic. I went out back yesterday to retreive the trash can before [someone stole it](http://www.blog.complainthub.com/?p=474), and I saw a note on the disaster magnet. I suppose I was being nosy in going to look, but I couldn't help it.

Someone had hit the car. Parked in the driveway. Who gets their car rear-ended while it's parked in the driveway? The person left a note, but seriously.

Even funnier, perhaps, is that I went out to retrieve the trash can after the salesman who was supposed to meet me to talk about installing garage doors at the back of the driveway stood me up. We want to put in doors because our driveway is currently the only one without them, which means that everyone turns around in our driveway. And sometimes hit the cars parked there.

Anyway, there wasn't a lot of damage (And the car still hadn't been repaired from last time, so he can get it all taken care of at once, that lucky guy).Â  But it's enough to send you to [Zipcar](http://www.zipcar.com).
