I know the Orioles are looking for another starter after sending Brian Burres to wherever they sent him (Is he on the ML roster? I don't even care). But it seems pretty clear that the starter they are looking for is not [Dennis Sarfate](http://www.baseball-reference.com/s/sarfade01.shtml). He has now started three games. I honestly can't decide which is his worst performance. He hasn't gotten through the fifth inning. His ERA is 11.45. His WHIP is 2.18. That's 13 hits and 11 walks in 11 innings. And the 13 hits I can even forgive. You can give up a hit even when you make a perfect pitch. It happens. But walking a batter per inning is just inexcusable. As [Satchel Paige](http://www.baseball-reference.com/p/paigesa01.shtml) (supposedly) said, "Throw strikes. Home plate don't move". I have no idea if he actually said that - it's often attributed to him, but it's never been entirely clear if he really said the things they say he said. But it's good advice nonetheless. At least if you throw the ball over the plate, you have a chance to succeed. I'm not interested in seeing him pitch any more. He wasn't a great reliever, and he's a miserable starter. It's really too bad [Jeremy Guthrie](http://www.baseball-reference.com/g/guthrje01.shtml) can't pitch every night.
