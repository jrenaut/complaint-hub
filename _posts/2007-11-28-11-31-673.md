410 words on the Metro this morning, and I'm almost at the end.  The 28th, today, is the latest I've ever hit 50,000.  And I don't think I'll make it today.  But I'm sure I will tomorrow. 

I'm a little disappointed that no one seems to notice me writing on the Metro.  Or maybe they do and just don't say anything.  I guess people don't talk much during rush hour.  But isn't it weird?  Have you ever seen somone writing in a little notebook on the Metro?  I think that's weird.  Of course, if I saw me writing on the Metro, I would look at me and think, 'Hey, that guy's kind of weird'.  Then I'd go back to reading or whatever I was doing.
