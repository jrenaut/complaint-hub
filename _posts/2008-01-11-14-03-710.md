[Techdirt: Mitch Kapor Finally Pulls The Plug On Chandler](http://techdirt.com/articles/20080110/145529.shtml)

> Every once in a while there would be an update, but many other projects seemed to make a lot more progress than Chandler ever did. So it's not much of a surprise to hear that Mitch Kapor has finally bailed on Chandler, and that the foundation behind it is going to scale back its efforts.

[BoingBoing: Chandler: Free, open calendar with awesome sharing](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/01/10/chandler-free-open-c.html)

> It's still very early beta, and there's a lot of polish missing from the current builds, but in the short time I've been using it, I've seen it make massive improvements. I'm really looking forward to future releases -- give it a whirl, send 'em some feedback, or hack some code.
