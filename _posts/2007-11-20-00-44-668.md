Finally.  Well, only a day late.  But I was 3,500 words behind on November 17th, which is the furthest back I've ever been.  This year has been tough.  I'm not sure exactly why.  The story is going slowly at the moment.  I don't like this most recent chapter, and I may be writing myself into a corner.  But, then again, that's what [Nanowrimo](http://www.nanowrimo.org) is all about.

I'm currently just about a day behind.  That's not a huge deal.  I can hopefully make that up by tomorrow or Wednesday.
