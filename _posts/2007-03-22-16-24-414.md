[Wirefly National Marathon](http://www.nationalmarathon.com/)

I just realized that my street is closed from 8:25AM to 12:05PM on Saturday as the marathon goes past. That should be interesting. Our flag football game is at noon, I think, so we'll have to make sure we can get the car out. I don't suppose parking around here is going to be easy at that point. Maybe we'll have to take the bus or something.
