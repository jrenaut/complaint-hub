I just hit 50,000 words. For some reason, the text file validator at the Nano site decided to give me 2,000 extra words, but since what really matters is less than vs. more than 50,000, and I'm definitely more than 50,000, who cares?

So now I spend some time with my wife, finish getting the condo ready to sell, then maybe work on my 2003 novel. Next week. That sounds like a plan.

Edited to add: I'm disappointingly not that excited about finishing this year. Yes, it's my fourth time out of five finishing. Yes, I know I can do it. But last year was more exciting.Â  Perhaps it's because I'm now firmly convinced that I need a new challenge (Like finishing a novel instead of just starting them).
