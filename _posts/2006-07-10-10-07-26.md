[Sales of organic beers start to hop - Yahoo! News](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060709/ap_on_bi_ge/organic_beer)

And those two things are Yahoo! News and dumb headline puns.

Actually, the two things I love are organic and beer.  I was in Giant yesterday because I was out running another errand (recycling cardboard, actually - I'm so environmentally friendly) and I was right next to Giant.  I never used to think there was much difference between one supermarket and another.  But now that we have a new super Safeway nearby, plus the Harris Teeter and Whole Foods, where I can get all kinds of cool organic food, the fact that Giant seems to have watched the organic bandwagon go flying by without so much as a wave is a big deal.

Now, I don't buy everything organic.  I'll buy "conventional" if no organic is available.  But it's always nice to be able to get the organic.

So now organic beer is starting to pick up.  That's great.  I do love beer. 

> Organic beer sales increased 40 percent in 2005, tying it with organic coffee as the fastest-growing organic beverage, the Organic Trade Association says. By comparison, overall U.S. beer sales fell slightly last year.

Awesome.
