[DCist: Rorschach Gets A New Home (For Now)](http://dcist.com/2008/02/20/rorschach_gets.php)

> The scrappy theater troupe has been hunting for months for a temporary home to finish out its 2008 season, after being bumped from its former spot at the Sanctuary Theater in Columbia Heights, a converted church space.

That sucks.  I hadn't been paying a ton of attention to what's going on at our local theater because the last few times I looked at their website, they had no announced dates for new shows.  And now I find out they're no longer our local theater.  We went to [one show](?p=470) a while back and really enjoyed it, and just hadn't gotten around to going again.

I hope this works out for them, but it sucks for Columbia Heights.
