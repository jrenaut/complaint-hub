The wife had the brilliant idea of heading out on our 84th [babymoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babymoon) before this kid finally arrives. Not that it hasn't traveled enough in utero - it's been to San Fransisco, NYC, Paris, LA, Boston, Las Vegas, Nashville, three MLB stadiums, an NBA finals game . . . And now it's been to a nice little [bed and breakfast](http://www.thelostdog.com) near Charles Town, WV. Our first stop was Harpers Ferry. We wandered around, had lunch, and took some pictures. We passed on the hiking, which is supposed to be nice, but since the wife is 39 weeks along, and my foot is still not totally recovered (The only shoes I can get on my foot at the moment are flip flops and my work shoes - my running shoes and hiking shoes both require more flexibility in my toe than I currently have), we didn't walk too far. And there were a ton of people tubing on the river, which looked really nice. The B&B; is in a town called Berryville, which unfortunately closes down at 6pm. Since we arrived at about 4, we didn't really get a good feel for the town. But we had a nice dinner in nearby Winchester. The B&B; itself was really nice. We've been encouraged to come back with the baby, as the proprietor is waiting to be a grandmother and has apparently tired of waited. However, it's not a really large place, and the sound tends to carry a bit (I could hear Law and Order all the way down the hall, even with the door closed), so I'm not sure the rest of the guests would appreciate it. The next day, we were served a great breakfast and then we headed out. Our first stop was a consignment store in Charles Town. We passed it on the way in and it was closed, so we went back and bought some baby clothes and two books (One was a Harold and the purple crayon book, which perhaps only my mom will appreciate). Then we were off to the wineries! We stopped at three - [Veramar](http://www.veramar.com/), [Bluemont](http://www.bluemontvineyard.com/), and [Willowcroft](http://www.willowcroftwine.com/). All three were very nice - much prettier than the average wineries. Bluemont, for example, is high up on a hill and offers a view of Tysons Corner thirty miles or so off in the distance. We stopped at the Leesburg outlets on the way back, which was probably a huge mistake given that it was Labor Day weekend, but we survived. And then back home. The cat didn't even seem too irritated with us.
