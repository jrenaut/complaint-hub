This is the most ridiculous overreaction to hacking and phishing attempts I've ever seen.  I just had to read a 30 page PowerPoint highlighting the dangers of PHISHING, and, even more dangerous, SPEAR PHISHING.  Did they make that up?  That's what they're calling the more specifically targeted phishing attempts.

Anyway, they've disabled ALL webmail.  Which means there are now two computers in my entire office where I can check my email.  My WORK email.  All because some DoD employees can't be bothered to learn basic web security, they're going to, once again, make it harder for me to do my job.
