[CNN.com - Pope: 'Total and profound respect for Muslims' - Sep 25, 2006](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/25/pope.muslims/index.html?section=cnn_topstories)

> Pope Benedict XVI expressed "total and profound respect for all Muslims" at a meeting Monday with ambassadors from Muslim nations and other Islamic leaders.

Really?  Is that why you said something insulting and inflammatory, then apologized for the reaction of the Muslim community?  If I punch you in the face, then say, "I'm sorry you were hurt", that's not a sincere apology for my actions.  That is saying, "I didn't do anything wrong.  It's unfortunate that you had a negative reaction to what I did."  It places the blame on the injured or offended party, and it does not show respect for anyone.
