I wish someone had told me you had to enable the Blog API module before you could use all the cool blogging tools like Flickr's "Blog This" or Firefox plugin [ScribeFire](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1730). I tried setting up both, and kept getting unhelpful errors. It looked like my username and password were wrong. This was frustrating, because I was sure my username and password were correct. After significant Googling, I finally found [a helpful explanation](http://drupal.org/node/295). And now it works perfectly. You can see the previous post, which I sent straight from Flickr. So, hopefully now this page will be one more Google hit explaining that, if you want an external site or application to access your xmlrpc.php file, you'd better turn on the Blog API module.
