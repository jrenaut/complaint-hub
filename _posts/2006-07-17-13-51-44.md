> No matter how many runs you get, you feel like they can come back and put a [hurt] on you like they did the first night.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't you usually use the word in brackets to add or replace words that are a little out of context?  For example, replacing a pronoun with the specific noun if you've chosen not to quote the previous sentence where the pronoun was defined.

What the heck is this [hurt] replacing?  Was there some even more obscure slang word there?  Profanity?  Did Sam Perlozzo, Orioles' manager and the quoted, make hand gestures?  We'll probably never know.

Also, allowing 5 hits and no runs in 5 2/3 innings is not a "gem", as the article states.  It's a solid start, but in my book, a "gem" is at least 7 full innings, and most of those innings better not contain any hits.
