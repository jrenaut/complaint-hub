And the Orioles have [lost their fifth in a row](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280507111&action=playvideo&hcmp=motion) to fall into last place. I think everyone saw this coming, but some of us held out hope it would come a little later in the season. It's pretty clear what the problem is - they've now scored fewer runs than anyone in the AL except Kansas City. Their runs allowed are tolerable, they just can't score. Still, they're nearly a third of the way to their predicted win total, and we're not even a quarter done with the season. So that's encouraging.
