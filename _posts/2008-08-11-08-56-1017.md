Steve Jobs has [reiterated](/blog/i-love-hate-iphone) that you're renting all $30 million worth of iPhone apps you've purchased. [Engagdet says](http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/11/jobs-60-million-iphone-apps-downloaded-confirms-kill-switch/), 

> [he] confirmed the controversial iPhone application kill switch in the event that Apple inadvertently approves a malicious program for distribution. Jobs said, "hopefully we never have to pull that lever, but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull."

He went on to say, "We know you all love to buy anything with our name on it, though, so you should be happy to repurchase anything we decide we don't want you to have anymore".
