So, the bread I made last night was fantastic. It's the kind of stuff you can just sit and eat. We haven't even tried toasting it or putting butter or anything else on it. I'm all ready to go out and find a good recipe for some fancier bread. Some 100% whole wheat, maybe some grains and other bits of goodness. Maybe some raisin bread, although the wife doesn't love raisin bread.

I would recommend that anyone who is disappointed by the quality of bread in the grocery store (Or the omnipresence of everyone's favorite, high-fructose corn syrup) [try baking his or her own](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/11/04/homemade-bread-cheap-delicious-healthy-and-easier-than-you-think/). Yes, it helps a lot to have a Kitchen Aid mixer, and I know these are not cheap, but you don't HAVE to have one, and it'll probably save you money in the long run if you actually bake your own bread regularly.

The instructions for baking, incidentally, are very detailed and easy to follow.Â  We had to look up how to prepare the yeast, which wasn't explained, but that wasn't too hard.
