[xkcd - A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language - By Randall Munroe](http://xkcd.com/c178.html)

New comic every M-W-F.  Always weird, often roll-on-the-floor funny.  And seriously, how many people do you know who could get a reference to Ubuntu Linux AND Pokemon into a one panel comic?

And if you're into webcomics, don't miss [Goats](http://www.goats.com) and [Unshelved](http://www.overduemedia.com/archive.aspx?strip=20061031), either.
