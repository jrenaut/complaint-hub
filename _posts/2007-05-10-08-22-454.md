[I just realized](http://www.blog.complainthub.com/?p=418) that the [movie script version](http://www.scriptfrenzy.org) of [National Novel Writing Month](http://www.nanowrimo.org) is kicking off its inaugural session in 21 days.

Since last year's Nano ended, I've moved from Northern Virginia to DC, which means that have a whole new group of fellow participants to not go out and meet.

Is there an active group of Columbia Heights (and nearby areas) Nanoers who plan to do Script Frenzy?
