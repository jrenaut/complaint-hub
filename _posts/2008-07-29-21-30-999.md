It's been a rough week for the Nationals. Since a 15-6 win over Atlanta on July 20th, they've lost six straight. Three of their last four games were shutouts, and tonight's game was a shutout until the 8th. They're still losing, 2-1, as I write this. They have the worst record in baseball. They've scored the fewest runs in all of baseball (Nearly 100 fewer than the next worst team in their division, and the only team in the majors with under 400 scored). But they sure have a nice park, huh?
