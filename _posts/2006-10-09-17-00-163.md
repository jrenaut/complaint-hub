So, I have honestly spent most of the day working at home. Now, to be fair, that was all spent installing Subversion, Java 1.5, the GWT, and Intellij IDEA, and it's still not all working, but I've been doing things for work since nine this morning. With a quick break to go to the grocery store and then fix lunch.

I'm close to getting something to work, though. So close. Right now, though, I'm going to get up from the computer. I think that will be best for my mental well-being. I might even go for a run, since I haven't done any physical activity since Friday.

Edit: _Good day for a run. Ran past an old coworker I haven't seen in over a year who now works right around the corner._
