The jerks at Astak have pushed back the release date of their [entry-level ebook reader](http://www.astak.com/5Ebook_Reader.html). [Again](/blog/another-ebook-reader-set-fail). Why can't someone release a reasonably-priced ebook reader that doesn't suck? The instant someone does it, _I will buy one_. Please, someone. Please. Not you, Sony. I wouldn't buy a fire extinguisher from you if my head was on fire. But anyone else.
