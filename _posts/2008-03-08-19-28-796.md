this scenario occurs all too often.&nbsp_place_holder; you are female, wishing to use the bathroom at a bar.&nbsp_place_holder; the bathroom has two stalls.&nbsp_place_holder; by the end of the evening, one stall has a door that will not lock & generally won't even close.&nbsp_place_holder; the other may have a functioning door/lock, but will inevitably house a commode hopelessly clogged with toilet paper and other more unpleasant things.&nbsp_place_holder; and the line of women intending to use such inadequate facilities will be out the door.&nbsp_place_holder;
