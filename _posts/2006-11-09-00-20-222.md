I'm all caught up on my novel as of right now. I'm not really ahead, as I'd like to be, but I've been behind since November 4th, so a little bit ahead is an improvement. The story is going well. I'm finding my main character less interesting than I'd hoped, and focusing more on some female characters. This is good for me because I always worry about writing female characters. I was told by a few female friends that the lead female in my 2003 novel was a slut (Although many disagreed), and I think these female characters are better. One of them might be a little bit of a slut, but one out of three isn't bad, right?

I forget every year how much I enjoy doing this. I really need to get myself writing outside of November. And I say that every year. Maybe this will be the year I get better about it.
