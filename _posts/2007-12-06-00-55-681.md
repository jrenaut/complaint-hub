When I first moved to the DC Metro area back in 2001, I was living in Fairfax, VA, and working on Wisconsin Ave NW.  I used to park on a little un-zoned residential street.  One winter, either 2001 or 2002, I forget, we had a big snow that was on the ground for a couple of weeks.  We got 4-6 inches, and then it just stayed cold.  Most of the cars in the neighborhood just didn't move.  For weeks, they just sat, covered in snow.

Now, today we got our first snow since we moved to the city, and my car is still covered.  I expect it will be covered tomorrow.  I mean, it's supposed to get up close to 40 degrees tomorrow, so there's not much point in clearing the car.  In fact, since street cleaning has been suspended for the winter, I don't expect to touch the car during the week until March or so.

Well, tomorrow we have errands to run in Virginia.  But other than that.

It's funny how quickly my attitude about driving has changed now that, for the most part, I don't have to do it.  Going a day without driving used to be really strange, and now it's the norm.

Anyway, the snow's kind of nice.  My commute is only outdoors for three blocks to Metro, and then a minute where the Yellow Line train goes over the Potomac into Virginia.  So the snow isn't really a concern.  I do have to take some trash out tonight, though.
