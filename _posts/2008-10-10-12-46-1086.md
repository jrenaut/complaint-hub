[BoingBoing | WalMart now says they'll keep the DRM servers on forever ](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/10/10/walmart-now-says-the.html) I [wrote about this](/blog/if-you-buy-anything-with-drm-you-are-stupid) when WalMart first announced that they were revoking your ability to play the music you "bought" from them, but it looks like they've changed their mind, [just like Yahoo](/blog/yahoo-isnt-bad-microsoft). Well, not quite like Yahoo, but the same idea. They're going to leave their DRM servers on for some undisclosed additional time. BoingBoing seems to think they'll leave them up permanently, but the press release doesn't actually say that. Regardless, WalMart is paying real money for their mistake, and it's always nice to see that. Except in this economy where we need WalMart to keep the entire country from going bankrupt. Then it kind of sucks.
