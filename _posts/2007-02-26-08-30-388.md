This weekend was the longest time I can remember while I was in the U.S. and didn't have an internet connection. I'm starting to twitch.

Seriously, it's not that bad, I guess, but there's stuff I need to get done that I don't want to do at work. And it would have been nice to be able to look up a few things over the weekend that actually were work-related. On a positive note, however, Comcast seems to think that they might be able to finally help us out this weekend. That would be cool.

Makes it a little hard to update, though. Fortunately, it was a quiet weekend.

We did get to [Sticky Fingers](http://www.stickyfingersbakery.com/index.php) for brunch on Sunday. I had coffee and a vegan cold cut sub, which was actually pretty good. And we had lunch with my mom and grandmother Saturday. Other than that, we mostly cleaned. The house is looking like a real place, although there's still stuff to do. I think I'm going to order blinds today so we can get them up in time for the housewarming party.
