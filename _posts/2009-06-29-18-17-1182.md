What in the world is wrong with the buses these days? Are people afraid of the Metro after the crash? It's been one awful commute after another for the last week and a half. This morning, two buses passed without picking up passengers. The one we finally got on didn't pick anyone up until U Street, passing crowded stop after crowded stop. And on the way home, I don't even know what happened. I Street was a parking lot, so the bus actually turned right on 15th instead of 16th. I saw this, started walking, and actually _beat the bus to 16th and L_. It turned left on K, right on 16th, and I was at 16th and L when it arrived, and while I walk briskly, I never ran. It looked like something was blocking traffic on 17th - I imagine I could figure out what with a little Googling, but it's not that important to me. On most weeks, I would just give up and work from home all week. But I actually have to be in the office at least tomorrow, and probably Wednesday, as well. Maybe tomorrow will be better.
