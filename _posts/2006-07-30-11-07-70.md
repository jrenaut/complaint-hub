Just opened my email box this morning to an email from American Airlines!  After all, it's only been a week, why wouldn't they have emailed me by now?

But it was just spam about their AAdvantage program.  Alas.  They had better get back to me soon.  My mouse moves ever closer to the "Click here to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau" button.
