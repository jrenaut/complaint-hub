I'm mostly just testing the Flickr's "Blog This" option. But it seems appropriate to post a photo from London right after David Beckham and his immaculate hair gave England a 1-0 win over Ecuador. It was really a nice goal, even if he does need to remember that he's a football player, not a fashion model.
