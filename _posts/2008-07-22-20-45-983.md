I complain a lot about Comcast Cable in DC. Any of you in the area waiting for Verizon Fios to come to DC and at least make Comcast pretend to compete know what I'm talking about. But they're actually doing something cool right now - they're doing a free preview of their MLB Extra Innings package. Unfortunately, it ends tomorrow, and I just found out about it today. And most of it isn't in HD. But it means I get to watch the first game of the big Mets-Phillies series, and watch the [big rivalry that no one (but my wife's coworkers) cares about](/blog/howard-vs-wright-its-no-contest), David Wright vs Ryan Howard. So far Wright is winning. Both are one for three, but Wright has a double, run, and RBI, while Howard just has a single. Good thing I'm not making rash statements based on small sample sizes. I'm a little tempted to pay $129 for Extra Innings for the rest of the season. But I watch too much tv as it is, and I don't REALLY need to watch out of market baseball games. Maybe when I retire.
