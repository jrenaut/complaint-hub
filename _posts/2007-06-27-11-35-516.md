The DMV told me to get a petition to have our street zoned residential.  The woman I talked to was very nice, but completely failed to address my concerns.  "Is there another street nearby that's not zoned where you could park on Tuesdays?"  Honestly, I don't know.  And I won't find out.  I was parked 15 feet from my front door, and I got a ticket designed to keep commuters from parking all day in residential zones.

I'm going to contest the ticket.  I'm going to write my councilmember.  I don't know if I'm adequately portraying how ridiculous this ticket is.  It means that I'm subject to a ticket, every Tuesday, unless I drive around and find some other street to park on that isn't zoned. 

This isn't over.  I will not pay this ticket.  If I can't park on the street where I live, then there's something deeply wrong with the system.
