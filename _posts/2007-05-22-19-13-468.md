[Boing Boing: Al Gore's impressively messy office](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/22/al_gores_impressivel.html)

It won't be the first time, nor the last, that I'll complain about Al Gore.  I'm still angry that he and his advisors weren't able to win a very, very winnable election against an opponent who has done very, very terrible things to our country.

I am not impressed with Al Gore's messy office.  Yes, I know that they say really smart people are often messy.  I don't care.  I'm not here to debate his IQ.  I am here to debate his dedication to his cause.  Does the man who is becoming synonymous with saving the environment really need three monitors and a television running?  Does he really need hard copies of all those books and papers?  And why not a reusable dry-erase board?

This is why you lost, Al.  On the rare occasions when you have a message, you can't stick with it.

I'm not really sure why Al Gore pisses me off so much.  Maybe I just need a nap.
