[Logan @ the Heights](http://www.theheightsdc.com/)

> The Heights is the quintessential neighborhood restaurant: perfect for a quick weekday bite, a night out with friends, or a lazy weekend Brunch.

The Heights is opening this Friday, according to signs in the window. I'm excited. I know it's not the neighborhood bar/restaurant that they'd like you to think it is. I mean, this is their fourth one, which is approaching chain-status. But Merkado is pretty good, and I've heard good things about the others, and this one is ours. Now we can tell those snooty Mount Pleasant jerks that they can keep their crappy bars.

I'm just kidding, really. The only Mount Pleasant bar I've been to is The Raven, and it's a cool place. And aside from the occasional "your neighborhood has more crime than our neighborhood" potshots, which are probably deserved, I like the people I know in Mount Pleasant. To be fair, that's really only one couple, but still.

Anyway, the wife has a friend in town Friday, so maybe we'll stop by the opening. Or maybe they have other plans. I don't really know. But you can be sure I'll try out The Heights eventually. And no, I don't plan on calling it Logan @ The Heights unless they call the one down there The Heights @ Logan.
