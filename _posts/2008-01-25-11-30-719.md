> The agreement on a stimulus package represented the first time since divided government returned to Washington a year ago that the two ends of Pennsylvania Avenue sheathed their swords and came together on a major initiative without any bloodletting first.

Is it just me, or did you think this was how it was supposed to work, all the time?  It shouldn't take the worst economic crisis in years to get politicians to do what we elected them to do.

This is one of the reasons I won't affiliate with a party anymore.  Politics is not supposed to be about advancing your cause and the cause of your party.  It's supposed to be about serving the people.  I think someone wrote that down somewhere a long time ago.  And that's why I'm supporting Obama - he's the only one running who I've ever even heard of saying something remotely related to bipartisanship.

And I think this is good for the country.  Even if the rebates don't fix the economy (And I don't think they will), I think it will help confidence a little bit to see the government come together and get something done quickly.  If the Senate blocks this, which the Post suggests they might, we should fire all of them.
