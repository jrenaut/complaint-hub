I don't have permission on my new work computer to even change the desktop theme from the stupid Windows XP theme back to the "Windows Classic" theme that I much prefer.  I'm not sure how anyone is expected to do a job on a computer without admin access.  Certainly there are people who don't know computers well enough to safely be granted that sort of power over their machine.  However, I think that computer classes, not ridiculous restrictions, are the answer there.

I honestly can not do my job on a computer without admin access.  I just can't do it.  Even if you forget about the convenience issues of being able to install the helpful software, there are real roadblocks that can not be overcome without admind access.  It's ridiculous.

I can't even use the Windows calendar because they have no "view only" mode.  I just want to see whether May 13th is a Saturday, but I can't. 

And I have to use Internet Explorer.  The horror.
