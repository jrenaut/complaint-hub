A friend once told me that, when considering two more or less equal candidates for a job opening, you should choose the one with a better commute. [Wait, where was I?](/blog/this-why-i-live-close-work) Oh, right. Today my commute involved tiptoeing past my daughter's room, hoping not to wake her, and sitting down at the table to get to work. There's, like, a blizzard, or something, going on out there. I have no meetings, and no one is really expecting me in the office, so I'm staying put. Daycare is opening three hours late, and since the snow is still coming down hard, they may not open at all. So I may have to watch her this afternoon anyway. If you're going in to work today, or going out anywhere, be careful.
