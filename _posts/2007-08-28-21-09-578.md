I have one functional OS. At least, mostly functional. I'm running Ubuntu now. Still no Windows, but I haven't tried to fix it.

My graphics card is not 100% (I don't have resolution higher than 1024, which kind of sucks). And the Gnome settings manager, which I haven't tried to fix. But wireless worked right out of the box, and here I am, posting away on the new machine.

It's pretty exciting. Still a little way to go, but my confidence is renewed.
