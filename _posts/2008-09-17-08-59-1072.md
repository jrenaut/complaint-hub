I'm back at work for the first time since the kid. It's not fun. She was up really late last night. The wife tried to get her down so I could sleep before work, but at 2AM she needed some help. The kid and I fell asleep on the couch sometime around 2:30, and here I am at work by 8:15. I have a two hour meeting at 9:30, and a shorter meeting at 1, and then I'm going home. So maybe five more hours. On the bright side, it's a pretty amazing feeling to listen to her slow down from screaming to crying to sleeping while I'm bouncing her up and down and whispering in her ear. In the long run, I suspect that's what I'll remember, rather than the sleepless nights.
