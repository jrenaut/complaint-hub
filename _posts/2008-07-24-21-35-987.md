Birthing class got out early tonight, and we don't have any food in the house. It's a combination of my bum foot and the wife's almost-full-term baby that leads to us not going to the grocery store. So we went to [The Heights](http://www.theheightsdc.com/) for dinner around 8pm. Thursday night is generally a nice night out, and tonight is some of the nicest weather we've had in a while. The Heights was full but not overcrowded. Most of the seats were taken, indoors and out. It was a diverse crowd - a pregnant couple with a friend on one side of us, a gay couple on the other. A woman and two young boys were being seated as we left. A couple walked in just in front of us, apparently having walked from somewhere nearby (I choose to believe that they walked from home rather than parking in the neighborhood). The food and the service were good. The wife says she's not sure that we've ever had a bad server there, and I certainly can't think of anything to contradict her. And I was impressed by their mixed greens salad that comes with all the entrees. It was plain lettuce, but it had cherry tomatoes, jicama, and beets, which is pretty exotic and healthful for your average restaurant. The buffalo shrimp appetizer was delicious, although a little light on shrimp. I recommend saving some bread to mop up the extra sauce rather than eating it with a fork, as someone at my table for two did this evening. Their rotating beer taps were not entirely exciting this time - Brooklyn Lager and a Sam Adams seasonal - but the idea of rotating taps is cool. The table next to us was raving about the bread pudding sundae, which we didn't order because we were both full. And we found that [Merkado](http://www.merkadodc.com/), a restaurant in Logan Circle owned by the same people, is closing at the end of August. In its place will be "a neighborhood place" called Commissary, hoping to emulate [Busboys and Poets](http://www.busboysandpoets.com/) and [Tryst](http://www.trystdc.com/). They hope to grab all the trendy kids who will move into the new building across from Whole Foods and take all their money. I'm a little sad that Merkado is closing - the wife and I had a lovely dinner there for my 29th birthday - but this sounds like an interesting replacement, although calling it "Commissary" is a little too hipster for my tastes.
