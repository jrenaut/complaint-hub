It is possible that I will upgrade to Drupal 6 tomorrow. If so, there may be some changes and some downtime for the site. Or maybe I won't get around to it, and there will be nothing. But I thought I'd warn everyone paying attention, just in case. Edit to add: No upgrade today. Didn't get a chance. Maybe next weekend.
