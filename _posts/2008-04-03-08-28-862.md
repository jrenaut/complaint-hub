[Box Score](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=280402101) The Orioles came back to win last night! Despite Cabrera allowing two runs and then leaving the bases loaded with no outs in the fifth, my new hero [Randor Bierd](http://www.baseball-reference.com/b/bierdra01.shtml) got them out of the jam. He allowed an inherited runner to score on a double play ball, and then got out of the inning. Then [Aubrey Huff](http://www.baseball-reference.com/h/huffau01.shtml) came through with a home run in the sixth and a go-ahead two run double in the bottom of the eighth for a 9-6 Orioles win! Wow! I might have watched the game, but the Celtics were on TV (Winning their 60th game), and I wouldn't think of denying the wife her Celtics. Meanwhile, if the season were only two games long, I would be [totally wrong](node/850) on [Brian Roberts](http://www.baseball-reference.com/r/roberbr01.shtml) having an off year. You can't ask for much more than a .600 batting average and 1.950 OPS (I know, small sample size, I don't care). Anyway, nice to see the Orioles get a win. In other baseball news, if you read [Fire Joe Morgan](http://www.firejoemorgan.com), you have probably heard their views on [David Eckstein](http://www.baseball-reference.com/e/eckstda01.shtml). If you don't, you can read them [here](http://www.firejoemorgan.com/search/label/david%20eckstein). I hope to see an article from them today about how Eckstein managed to score using nothing but grittiness and his monstrous, monstrous heart. Eckstein has nine at bats this season. In eight of them, using his bat, he has managed to get zero hits, one strikeout, and hit into two double plays. But in his first at bat last night, he used his "intangibles" and made Jason Giambi commit an error, allowing Eckstein to reach first base! I didn't watch the game, and the ESPN box score doesn't specify, but I suspect that Giambi was mesmerized by the dirt on Eckstein's uniform, despite the fact that he was the first batter of the game. He was so mesmerized that, when Eck weakly hit the ball towards him, Giambi just didn't pick it up. Now safely on first, Eck really began to shine. It doesn't show up in any "numbers" or "sabermetrics", but it was really Eckstein's heart that allowed him to advance to second base on Shannon Stewart's single, and his keen baseball sense that sent him around to score on Alex Rios' single. The other two batters had little to do with it. Edited to add: [They posted about Eck](http://www.firejoemorgan.com/2008/04/fun-with-small-sample-sizes-vol-dxii.html), but not about his gritty grittiness grittying a run.
