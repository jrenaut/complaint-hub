if you're on a crowded bus during rush hour, please do not use that time to test every single one of your cell phone rings to determine which will be the coolest one to use.&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;

and i think the same can be said if you're on an uncrowded bus.&nbsp_place_holder; or metro - crowded or uncrowded.&nbsp_place_holder; in fact, in any public space.&nbsp_place_holder; and at any time, not just rush hour.&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;
