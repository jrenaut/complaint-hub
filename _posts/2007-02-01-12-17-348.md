I've got some changes in mind for this site.  I've been working on some things, although it's hard to find time with moving and everything and still wanting to spend a little time with my wife.  But she's got stuff she has to get done tonight, so I'm hoping to get some work done while she's busy with that.  My lack of success installing a test MySQL server on my Windows machine is not helping things, but the primary change I'm looking to make right away shouldn't depend on the database anyway.  Maybe tonight.  This site might be down briefly as I move it to a subdomain.

Anyway, we'll see how it goes.
