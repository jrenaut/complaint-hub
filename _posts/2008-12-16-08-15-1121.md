[Petition to "Get a Secretary of Real Food appointed" in Obama Administration](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/485859096/petition-to-get-a-se.html) BoingBoing points us to "[a petition at fooddemocracynow.org](http://www.fooddemocracynow.org/) that asks Obama's transition team to consider six candidates - all experienced, viable names of people who are ready and willing to serve - for Secretary of Agriculture who could potentially mend our broken food system. Already, after only six days, 36,000 people have signed the petition, including Michael Pollan, Alice Waters, and Bill Niman, and the Obama transition team appears to be paying attention." If you've ever looked at the ingredients on a loaf of bread, the portion sizes at a restaurant, or any number of other things, it becomes pretty obvious that the way we eat and the way we produce food is horribly broken. I am honestly scared of the things that my daughter will be expected to consume when she goes off to school, and she has the advantage of coming from a home where both parents eat well, lots of vegetables, not so much processed stuff, organic when available, etc. What about the millions who don't know how or can't afford to eat well? If the Obama transition team really is listening, this is a petition worth signing. I encourage you to sign it. I just did.
