[Dutch firm launches phone with fold-away screen | Tech&Sci | Technology | Reuters.com](http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=technologyNews&storyID=2008-01-21T192833Z_01_L20634124_RTRUKOC_0_US-POLYMERVISION-GADGET.xml&pageNumber=0&imageid=&cap=&sz=13&WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage2) via [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/347272/philips-readius-materializes-with-fold+away-screen). 

> "You get the large display of e-reading, the super battery life of e-reading, and the high-end connectivity ... and the form factor and weight of a mobile phone," said Karl McGoldrick, chief executive of the venture capital-funded firm, in which Philips still has a 25 percent stake.

In what hopefully will be an unpleasant development for Amazon's locked up Kindle, a company spun off of Phillips is planning to bring a phone to market in 2008 that uses fold out e-paper.  This is pretty awesome.  If they release it in the States around the time that Verizon opens up their network, this could change the whole marketplace for mobile devices.

Or it could be another expensive toy that the wife tells me not to buy.
