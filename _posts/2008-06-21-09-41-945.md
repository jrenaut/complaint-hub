[Gizmodo | Knight Rider GPS With KITT's Voice!](http://gizmodo.com/5018469/knight-rider-gps-with-kitts-voice)

> Apparently, you will recognize his familiar voice as soon as you fire it up and hear "Hello Michael, where do you want to go today?"

The wife doesn't think this is awesome, which would be grounds for divorce if she wasn't so cool otherwise. But this is a GPS that gives you directions with KITT's voice. There are two things that would be cooler. One, if you could get it to say your own name instead of "Michael". Although it would be cool if it asked where Michael was now and then. And two, the whole turbo-boost, auto-drive, and bullet-proof-ness of KITT would be pretty awesome. But I guess that's a little much to ask from a $300 device.
