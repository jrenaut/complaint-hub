[Short-handed United Holds Off Chivas's Rush - washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/26/AR2007092602842.html)

> Despite playing a man down for the second half, United held off an unrelenting Chivas attack to emerge with a 2-1 advantage in front of a split crowd of 21,022.

Yeah, that last two in the crowd was the wife and me. One of her new coworkers has season tickets, and couldn't make the game last night, and we were the lucky beneficiaries. Fantastic seats in the VIP section, just at midfield.

There's a good atmosphere to DC United games. The fans are into it, they're loud, and mostly pretty friendly. I did overhear a DC United fan make a rude comment to a Chivas fan while we were in line buying popcorn. The rude comment and the response were in Spanish, so I might have misunderstood, but one of the words that the Chivas supporter used in his response was definitely not friendly. It's one of those words that doesn't really have a direct translation into English, but I've always thought of it as the Spanish equivalent to a popular compound English curse word.

Anyway, the game was good - DC scored first, lost a man to a red card, then both sides scored second half goals. We should go to more games. It's not expensive, compared to baseball or football.
