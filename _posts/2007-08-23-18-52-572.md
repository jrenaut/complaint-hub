Thank you for writing Councilmember Graham.  The Councilmember is in El Salvador at the invitation of the Mayor of San Salvador for meetings of mutual interest.  On Aug. 1, he was presented the key to the city by the Council and the Mayor.  He has participated in many meetings, as well as two parades.

In his absence, I am forwarding your message to Jonathan Kass, on his staff.

Sincerely,

Jason Yuckenberg Public Information Officer Office of Councilmember Jim Graham
