I found [AbeBooks](http://www.abebooks.com) a few months ago.  I don't remember how, but I'm glad I did.  They're a book search service for new and used books at small booksellers all over the country.  I just bought [Charles Stross](www.antipope.org/charlie/)' latest, _Halting State_, for less than Amazon (Well, barely less, but still less), and I feel smug because I'm supporting some local bookstore in Georgia rather than a gigantic corporation like Amazon.

Used books are even better - I've bought a couple books for $1 + $3 shipping.  If it costs less than five dollars, it might as well be free.  Sort of.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to the book.

I'm currently reading _Terrorist,_ by [John Updike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Updike).  I read one of his early books, _Rabbit, Run_, written in 1960.  This one is from 2006.  So far I like it, although I'm only 80 pages in or so.  I wonder if I'm on some sort of watch list because I'm reading a book called "Terrorist" on the Metro right past the Pentagon.  I hope so.
