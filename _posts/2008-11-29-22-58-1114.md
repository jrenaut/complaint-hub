So [here](/files/Monuments_to_Nothing.pdf) is my 2008 [Nanowrimo](http://www.nanowrimo.org) novel, _Monuments to Nothing_. It is shared here under a [Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/). That means you can read it, share it with your friends, write a sequel to it, edit it, write fan fiction about my characters, or ignore it. If it is possible that you are my Christmas secret stocking person, you _should not read it_ yet. You may not present it as your own, share it without giving me credit, share it or derivative works under a more restrictive license, or use it commercially. Unless you ask me and I say it's okay. The story has a little bit of sex, violence, and profanity. Nothing really crazy, but I feel I should warn people. Enjoy.
