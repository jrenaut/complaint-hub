You may have seen comments from GayleForceWinds here before, or you may actually know her. I'm now announcing that she's fired. From what, you may ask. From nothing. Just fired.

As you may also know, Gmail has a built in chat program that can be set to display the music you're currently listening to.

About ten minutes ago, Gayle was listening to "Heaven is a Place on Earth" by Belinda Carlisle, and now that infernal song is stuck in my head.  I didn't even _hear_ it, and it's in my head.

I can't adequately explain how much I hated that song back in the late '80s. I didn't hate it as much as Debbie Gibson's "Shake Your Love", but I hated it a little more than Tiffany's "I Think We're Alone Now".

And I'm not really sure why.  Sure, they were perky pop stars who seemed way too happy all the time (Well, not so much Tiffany, which is probably why I didn't hate her song as much), but why that would evoke such a reaction is beyond me.

Anyway, thanks a lot, GayleForceWinds.  I won't forget this.
