Have you ever typed your name into a search engine? I have a relatively unusual last name, at least outside of French-speaking countries, so most of the results for my name are actually me. That's kind of nice. Then, earlier this evening, a friend told me, "you aren't that hard to find on teh intrawebs". That got me thinking - I wonder what else is out there? For the first time, I googled my usual screenname, _thetejon_, which I've used for most everything ever since I had my first AOL account. The results are pretty impressive. Some of the most interesting: [Wedding Toasts for the Groom](http://www.ourweddingplus.com/blog/wedding-toasts-for-the-groom/) - a blog post that used a picture of me giving a toast at the wedding of one good friend to another. [2006 October PUNK Blogs & News @ PROPUNK.COM!](http://propunk.com/2006/10/page/93/) - I suspect this site runs scripts to scrape content tagged with "punk" from wherever it can find it and hopes to generate ad revenue. The picture they got is actually of my cat. [большое спасибо мите за лицензионный balance 005](http://da-stank.livejournal.com/98496.html) - a LiveJournal entry linking to one of my photos from Costa Rica. The entry is not in a language I'm familiar with. Perhaps you are. So, there you go. Think about that next time you do something stupid on the internet. Google doesn't forget.
