Wednesday's [post](/blog/this-why-i-live-close-work) got into [The Express](http://expressnightout.com/content/2009/01/obama_says_dc_needs_to_get_snow_tough.php). For those not familiar, The Express is a free paper that gets handed out all over the city, most importantly on Metro - I'd guess that anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 of all Metro riders as least browse The Express a couple times a week. I won't complain about being in the Express - I think it's awesome. I've occasionally seen blogs I know in there, but never mine. Anyway, it figures that they'd notice me on a day when I'm being a bit of a jerk. I was in a bad mood because of my meeting later in the day (1:30 to 4! That's too long for any meeting) and, as I am prone to do, I mouthed off about something that wasn't really what was bothering me, but was sort of related and was handy at the time. So that's my complaint. Noticing me on a bad day. Why couldn't they have noticed on a better day? Like January 24th, 2007? My mom and I agree that [this](/ch/340) is one of my best posts. Or maybe on July 8th, 2008, when I [got hit by a friggin' truck](/blog/crosswalk-misadventures)? In any event, they say there's no such thing as bad publicity, and my hits _were_ up yesterday. So, those of you who came to see that post, hang out and read a few more and realize that Wednesday was not an accurate reflection of me as a human being. I may be a complainer, but I'm not a jerk.
