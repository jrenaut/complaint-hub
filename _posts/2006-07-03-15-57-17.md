[Experts debate labeling children obese - Yahoo! News](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060703/ap_on_he_me/diet_obese_or_not)

There's a ridiculous bit of debate on whether we should tell kids that they are "overweight" or "obese", or whether we should use other words so the kids don't feel bad. The real problem here is that they still use BMI to determine overweight. BMI is a ridiculous, meaningless number. Let's say I'm in perfect shape. I eat healthy foods and exercise regularly. Then I decide to bulk up a bit, and I hit the gym and gain ten pounds of muscle. According to my BMI, I am now less healthy.

It's ridiculous. Kids are fat. They eat terribly, and don't exercise enough. And we want to worry about hurting their feelings?
