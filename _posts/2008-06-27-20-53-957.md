It's nice to see Hillary finally putting the party and her country before herself.   
  
I'm just kidding. I'm finding it difficult to be annoyed with her at this point - she lost, and now she's helping Obama, because that's what you do when you finish second in a really close and strongly contested race. She's very capable, and she's very smart, and I think she can be a great asset to the Obama campaign. I'm just glad she's not going to be President.  
  
By the way, if you're not friends with Obama on Flickr, you're a total loser.
