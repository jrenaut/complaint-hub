A to-do list for the next ten days: 

  1. Fly to London this afternoon.
  2.  Take a train to York.
  3. Hang out in York for a few days.
  4. Rent a car, drive a manual transmission on the wrong side of the road for the first time.
  5. Be 1/2 of that cool couple that came all the way from the States to the wedding.
  6. Fly to Dublin.
  7. Enjoy a delicious Guinness at a pub.
  8. Repeat #7 as necessary.
So, I'll be out until Friday the 13th.  I don't expect internet access while I'm gone.  But, I'll bring back pictures.  And memories.
