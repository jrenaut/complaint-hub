> Global Warming got you down? Wish your city had better recycling programs or more bike lanes? These are some of the issues that the Complaints Choir of Helsinki and the Complaints Choir of Birmingham are singing about.

If I could sing, I would totally want to do this.  These two groups sing about their complaints.  I'm sure my compatriot over at [VentBox](http://blog.ventbox.com/) will be interested to see this, as well.

Score one point for those of us who call it complaining rather than venting.
