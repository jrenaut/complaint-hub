I recently [posted](/blog/monuments-nothing-my-2008-nanowrimo-novel) my [Nanowrimo](http://www.nanowrimo.org) [novel](/files/Monuments_to_Nothing.pdf) for any and all to read. I'm curious if anyone did. I know one friend did, and I know more people downloaded it. And it hasn't been that long - if you had posted your Nanowrimo novel, I probably wouldn't have read it yet, either. But I'm curious if anyone has read it, or at least started it, and has anything to say about it. Constructive criticism is preferred, although vitriolic rants on my incompetence as a writer are always welcome. The [friend](http://www.vinotrip.com) who read it asked if I had read it since November ended. I told him I hadn't, and he said it would probably be a good idea if I did. It is a rough draft, after all. And as is my Nano usual, the story changed from my original plans as I wrote it, so some of the early stuff might not fit with the later stuff. I'm not sure if I want to keep working on it. I'd love to publish something one day, but I don't really know if this is the one to try with or not.
