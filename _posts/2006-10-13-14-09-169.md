[Accidental Hedonist - Coke's Caloric Sophistry](http://www.accidentalhedonist.com/index.php/2006/10/13/coke_s_caloric_sophistry)

There are a couple things wrong with this.  First, they say that drinking three twelve ounce cans will burn about 100 calories.  Okay, fine.  How many calories are in a can?  There's about 140 calories in a 12 ounce can of Coke.  Unless each can of this new stuff is less than 35 calories or so (Highly unlikely, but I can't find the number online), even if the calorie-burning claims are correct, you're still taking in more than you're burning.

Second, you'd burn about 35 calories taking a slow walk for ten minutes.  35 calories is not that much.

Third, "The makers claim that a combination of extracts from green tea and caffeine speeds up the drinkerâ€™s metabolic rate, which helps the body to burn calories".  How many can I drink in a day before my metabolic rate is at an unsafe level?  Artificially speeding up your metabloic rate just doesn't seem like a good idea to me.

Fourth, "But, this is a positive step that people can take to make a difference to their health with regular physical activity and a balanced, healthy diet."  So says Rhoma Applebaum, chief scientist for Coke.  Everything I'm reading from Coke implies that this is a health drink.  That is, something that will help you be healthy.  Is it healthy like Diet Coke is healthy?  I mean, sure, drinking it is probably healthier than drinking straight high-fructose corn syrup, or drinking battery acid.  But I doubt drinking one of these Envigas is healthier than drinking nothing.

Anyway, I love Coke.  Not the company, but the soda.  I know it's bad for me, and that's why I try not to drink it too often (Although I should drink less of it).  But this stuff is being marketed deceptively, and I'd like to see Coke get sued for it.
