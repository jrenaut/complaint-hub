I have 2145 words done in my screenplay. I'm supposed to have 4669 done by midnight tonight. That puts me 2524 words behind schedule. But I've got nothing scheduled for this evening except writing and probably ordering sushi delivery, so I fully intend to do some catching up.

Edit: I'm at 2808 now. Still going, hopefully. The wife put on the NBA finals.
