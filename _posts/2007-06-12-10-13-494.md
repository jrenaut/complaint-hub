What's going on at Mount Vernon Square Metro?  I've been riding the Green line to there and picking up the Yellow line to get to Pentagon City since March.  Yesterday, the Green line train overshot its normal stopping point by about half a six-car train-length.  This wouldn't have been such a big deal, except that I usually sit in one of the back two cars - they tend to be less crowded as everyone stuffs themselves into the middle few cars.

I refuse to run for a Metro (Which is probably a little silly, but I don't care.), but I will walk briskly.  Which I did, and I made it before they closed the doors.

Then, this morning, the Green line train stopped at about that same spot, half a train-length past the normal spot.  The Yellow line picked up at the normal spot.

What is Metro trying to do?  I don't appreciate it.  I'm a creature of habit, which includes standing in the same spot on the platform every day.  And I expect the train to cooperate.
