So, I got the partitioning right. And I cleaned out the old version of Ubuntu.&nbsp_place_holder; Except that I installed OpenSUSE on top of my new version of Ubuntu, and didn't clean out the GRUB entries from my old install.&nbsp_place_holder; So now I can run OpenSUSE (Which doesn't recognize my wireless card) and that's it. It got late last night and I didn't try installing again, but maybe tonight.&nbsp_place_holder; I have to look up how to clean out old entries from GRUB. I think maybe I can just delete the whole thing, and it will be remade when I reinstall Ubuntu, but I'm not totally sure. My initial impression of OpenSUSE is good, although I think I'm going to download 11.1. I got 11.0 back in June and never installed it, and now the next version is out.&nbsp_place_holder; It looks like the graphical installer got some major upgrades, so I think I will take advantage. That is something that Ubuntu needs to work on - I gave up on their graphical installer after three straight versions refused to play nice with my video card. Anyway, now I'm stuck at work and can't do anything fun, but I hope to have both operating systems up and running by tomorrow. I'll post a comparison eventually.
