> Pixar, recently purchased by Disney, could crank out multi-billion dollar confections. . . And yet, instead, they make a great movie. A movie for the ages. A film, not 90 minutes of commerce.

I don't know what the deal is with this movie. I know people love everything Pixar does. But with a few exceptions (people, not movies), I figured it was just that people like to watch stupid garbage like American Idol and I Survived a Japanese Game Show. But the reaction to [Wall-E](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/) is ridiculous. Everything I've read about this movie has been superlative.  
  
I guess the wife and I will have to go see it. We haven't been to the movies in a while.
