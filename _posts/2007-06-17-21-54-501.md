The wife and I spent the weekend in Philadelphia. I've been there a few times, but not recently, and not for long. Philly has kind of a bad reputation, but it doesn't seem deserved. The city is clean, there's lots to do, and we had a good time. Maybe if we stayed longer, we'd find some reason to hate the city, but I have no complaints.

As you can see from the photo, the Latham Hotel has a bottle opener in the bathroom. How many times have you been in a hotel, and had to open a beer by banging it on the door hinge? I mean, that happens to me ALL THE TIME. And it's not a really good way to open a beer. The Latham takes care of that. 

Anyway, we got to see a lot of the city. We met up with some friends, had a really great dinner at Amici Noi on Market Street, and walked around a lot. It was a really nice weekend.
