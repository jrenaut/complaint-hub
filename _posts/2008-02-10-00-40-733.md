I was poking around on one of my favorite websites, [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com), and found that [my favorite presidential candidate](http://www.barackobama.com) not only has an [account](http://www.flickr.com/people/barackobamadotcom/), but shares all his photos with a [Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/).

For all of you internet communist [Techdirt](http://www.techdirt.com)-fanatic geeks (like me) who believe that non-scarce resources (like photos and MP3s) should be free (And there is extensive economic theory that reinforces this), this is awesome.

Not that I needed another reason to vote for the guy - he's the only one running who I trust with my country, even if I don't agree with him on a lot of the issues.Â  But if I were looking for more reasons, this would be one of them.

Now I just have to figure out a non-commercial use for one of his photos so I can take advantage of the license.
