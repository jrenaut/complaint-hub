> Women are more disciplined drinkers and physically smaller. This in turn leads to less consumption and a lesser need to collect.

_Disclaimer - a good friend of mine works for Vinfolio, the source of this post. That probably doesn't matter, but I thought I'd let you know anyway._

So, why is wine collecting male-dominated? I don't think it's because women are smaller. The first (currently only) comment on the post suggests that collecting in general is more of a male thing_. _I certainly know more males who collect stuff. And I think women collect stuff more as decoration. Maybe that's just the impression I get from the women collectors I know, and doesn't accurately reflect women overall.
