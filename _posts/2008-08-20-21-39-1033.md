None of you will get this at all, but I have to share. It really means a lot when [a friend](http://www.marketingfinanceobama.com/) spends $10 just to make fun of you. Case in point - [Sony Complain Thub](http://www.sonycomplainthub.com/). It all started with a thread on our super secret private forum where we <del>complain about our wives</del> talk about sports. The thread was about the Patriots, and it came up that I was rooting for them in the last Super Bowl. This is because I am a Redskins fan, and I would root against the Giants if they were playing absolutely anyone except the Cowboys, and in certain situations, even then. Anyway, this came as a surprise to some. I responded thusly: 

> I really don't think there's anything the Patriots could do that would make me root for the Giants or the Cowboys. Maybe if they went two tight ends with Winslow and Shockey, changed the team name to the Sony Complain Thub, and violated the GPL a couple hundred times. I mean, I still hate the Patriots, and it was like rooting to lose an eye vs lose both eyes, but a Pats win would still have been preferable to me.

Of course, that was a small bit of hyperbole, and a large bit of inside joke, but still, relevant to the link that you may or may not have clicked above.
