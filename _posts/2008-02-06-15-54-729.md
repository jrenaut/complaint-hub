[McSweeney's Internet Tendency](http://mcsweeneys.net/) - finally with RSS! While they offer a title-only feed, which I'm not sure I've ever even seen, at least they're making progress.

I guess they want you to come to the site and see the ads for their various books and subscriptions and such, but it still seems very odd not to at least offer a teaser in addition to the title.
