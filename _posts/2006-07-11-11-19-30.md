[Treehugger: Pearl Jam Announces Carbon Portfolio Strategy](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/07/pearl_jam_annou.php)

Pearl Jam has announced that they are giving "$100,000 to nine different non-profits 'doing innovative work around climate change, renewable energy, and the environment'", and hope to get to 0% net emissions for their tours and business.

I haven't listened to much Pearl Jam lately, mostly because I haven't liked much they've done since "Ten", but "Ten" was one of the top five or so albums released in the last 20 years, and ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS STUPID. Just kidding. Anyone who says otherwise isn't necessarily stupid. They're wrong, but not necessarily stupid.

This does make me want to go out and buy the latest Pearl Jam cd. Do you think they're selling a DRM-free copy?
