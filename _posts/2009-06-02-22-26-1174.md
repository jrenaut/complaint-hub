I think I posted a while back that I'm going to see [Nine Inch Nails](http://www.nin.com) next week. I've been a fan ever since I saw the video for Head Like a Hole on MTV a million years ago, but I've never been to a show. This is their last tour "for a while", which maybe means forever, so I just bought tickets. I just found out today that Jane's Addiction, the worst band in the history of the Universe, is actually going on _after_ Nine Inch Nails. This is the best news ever. Now, I don't know if there are Jane's Addiction songs that don't suck - the only ones I know are the few that got on the radio back when I was actually listening to the radio. But the ones I know are truly and amazingly awful. Sorry if you're a fan, but that just means you have bad taste in music. It's really your fault. In any event, I'm pretty excited.
