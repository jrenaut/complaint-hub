I was searching through my Gmail spam folder, looking for names for the characters in my [Script Frenzy](http://scriptfrenzy.org) screenplay, and I came across this surreal piece of art. I'm pretty sure that the sender, Rosanna RODGERS, didn't intend for me to see the beauty in this piece (Which I reproduce nearly as she sent it, just with some line breaks to really give it some pop). She probably wanted me to buy generic Cialis or Tramadol or go see naked Russian teens or something.

I'm not a big fan of poetry, but in my book, this is right up there with Poe's "The Raven".
