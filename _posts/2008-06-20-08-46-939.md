> A 21-YEAR-OLD man has gone missing after a night out in a city centre. Police are searching for Jonathan Jenkins who was last seen in Wind Street in the centre of Swansea last Sunday evening.

This is the text of a spam comment I got on one of my older posts. It also included some links to buy cheap cigarettes online, which I won't include here. It's interesting that the spammers are starting to tell little stories about what they're trying to sell you.

I've never understood why they don't edit these things. If they had posted this with no grammatical mistakes and only one link, it probably would have gotten through my spam filter. Anyway, just thought I'd share the comment before I deleted it. Here's another.

Be careful while smoking! Follow the smoking instruction here:
