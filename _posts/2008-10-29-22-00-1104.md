One of my favorite authors, Charles Stross, is [going to do Novel Writing Month](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2008/10/back_home_part_30.html) this year. Stross' [Iron Sunrise](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441012965?ie=UTF8&tag=comphub08-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0441012965)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=comphub08-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0441012965) is one of my favorite books, and those of you paying attention know that I've [met him](/node/858) over delicious beers at [the Brickskeller](http://lovethebeer.com/brickskeller.html). I know [Nanowrimo](http://www.nanowrimo.org) is not quite the same for someone who makes a living writing novels as it is for someone who just wishes he had the motivation and dedication to make a living writing novels (You'll notice I don't say I lack the skill - I have the skill until I prove otherwise). But it's cool to be writing along with someone who writes really cool stuff, who is successful doing professionally something that I do now and then as an amateur. Now I just have to figure out how to get my daughter to sleep for a few hours in the evening so I can actually write my 50,000 words.
