The MASN HD feed on Comcast in DC is simply the worst quality HD signal I've ever seen. I actually turned on the non-HD feed, hoping it would be better. It wasn't. I know no one cares about the Orioles, but they're playing the Yankees. You'd think someone in their organization would make sure the DC-area Yankee fans could watch the game in peace, and then I could benefit indirectly. <del>At least the Orioles are winning.</del> At least Adam Jones just hit his first career grand slam to put the O's up, 11-0, in the sixth.
