> When the handler and monkey go through the WTMD and the WTMD alarms, both the handler and the monkey must undergo additional screening.

[BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net) posted this today, but they didn't quote this rule, which is quite possibly the funniest.  I mean, the nerve of the American public, thinking that they can set off alarms and allow their monkey to get off scot free.

"Sir, your monkey is going to have to step over here for further screening."

It's worth becoming disabled and getting a helper monkey just for the airport hilarity that this could cause.  Even better than wearing an ["enemy combatant" t-shirt](http://www.zazzle.com/product/235675514210266845) through the security line.
