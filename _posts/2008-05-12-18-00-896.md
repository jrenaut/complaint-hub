If you guessed this guy, you win! Your prize is that you get to come by and ice my foot for 48 hours after I have a [bunion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunion) removed from the joint of my left big toe. No, my foot doesn't look like the one on the Wikipedia page. Mine isn't nearly that bad. The joint is just a little red and sticks out a little more than it should. I've been having some pain in my foot for a while. I thought it was related to running, but it turns out that running was just making it uncomfortable, not causing it. Bunions, it turns out, are hereditary. My sister had one removed maybe last year, and says the surgery wasn't too bad. I'll be off my feet for two days, then I get to wear some special shoe/sandal thing for 4-6 weeks, and then I'm fine. It doesn't sound too terrible. And in the meantime, I'm free to do what I want on it - I can run and jump and dance and all that. Not that I do much dancing. But the only restrictions on what I can do before I have it removed are my own level of comfort, which is nice.
