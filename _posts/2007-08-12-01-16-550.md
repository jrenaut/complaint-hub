I'm making some progress with my [baseball game](?p=560). I've switched from Gedit to [Anjuta](http://anjuta.sourceforge.net/), which I'm pretty happy with so far. Very lightweight, easy to use.

I'm fooling with pointers now, and remembering that I never really understood them when I was doing C++ before. So I'm figuring it out now. Slowly. I knew there was a reason I liked Java.

Anyway, it's been going reasonably well.Â  I need to get over a little hump in general C++ knowledge, and then I should start making better progress.
