[This one](http://jalopnik.com/5272543/car-towed-after-contractor-lifts-car-paints-stripes) happened across the pond, not in DC, but this story is nearly as good as [our local hero](/blog/this-man-my-hero) who beat DC parking enforcement. They decided to change some parking rules in (near?) London. To do this, they paint double lines on the street right next to the curb. This is in stark contrast to the ridiculous signs they put up here in DC, or sometimes the total lack of markings, requiring you to just _know_ that you can't park within five feet of an alley. So this woman's car was parked legally before the unpublicized change to the rules. After the change, she would be illegal. So what did they do? They _lifted her car off the ground_, painted the lines, and put the car back down. Parking enforcement then came by and towed her for parking illegally. The article linked above has an awesome picture. She eventually got her MP involved and was refunded the 2400 pound fine (I think the exchange rate is better now than it was last time I was over there, but that's still nearly $4000). By the way, Express, feel free to quote me again, but try to [get it right this time](/blog/compare-and-contrast).
