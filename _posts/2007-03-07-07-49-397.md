A bunch of MD and VA schools are already closed. There's a dusting of snow on the ground. I'm at work in VA, and I'm pretty sure the snow emergency is going to trap me here for at least six days. 

Where's your global warming now, Al Gore? Snow in March! It must be a new Ice Age.

Seriously, the snow is just annoying at this point. I'm ready for spring. This winter had a nice run, but now it's time for flowers and birds and walking around in flip flops.
