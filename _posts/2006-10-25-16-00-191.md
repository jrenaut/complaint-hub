[outside.in](http://outside.in/)

> outside.in is designed to change all that, as a bridge between information space and real-world space -- a place to see in a single glance all the interesting things that are happening around you.

I've read about this on at least three blogs already, so I figured I might as well check it out. It's user-based content, so there's not much there yet, although with all the pimping it's getting from big shots like [John Battelle](http://www.battellemedia.com) and [David Pescovitz at BoingBoing](httpe://www.boingboing.net), it shouldn't be long before they have a good user community.

The idea is that you will go and provide local information about where you live, and be able to find similar information about other places.  Or you might find that little hole in the wall restaurant around the corner that you've never noticed.

Nice idea.  Execution looks pretty good, although I didn't poke around too much.  It's certainly designed better than [HotSoup](http://www.hotsoup.com).
