You can hear it on the [NIN MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/nin).  I'm really not sure whether I think a Nine Inch Nails MySpace page is one of the great things about the internet, or one of the signs that it's all ready to come crashing down.

Nine Inch Nails is one of the few bands whose cd I will buy without hearing anything from it.  It's a pretty short list, especially after Garbage's most recent cd refused to let me rip MP3's and they fell off the list.  Actually, the list may just be Nine Inch Nails at this point.  Cake's most recent cd was pretty mediocre.

Anyway, hearing that the new cd is coming out in April is the first time I've been excited about music in a while.  I haven't listened to music on the radio in a long time.  When HFS went away, leaving us with only DC101, I mostly switched to NPR.  I'm tired of the RIAA, of copy-protection, of DRM.  And I'm tired of the same old crap music being played over and over.

But I should have a new cd on April 17th.    I'm looking forward to it.
