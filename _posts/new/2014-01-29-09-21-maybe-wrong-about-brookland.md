title: Maybe I was wrong about Brookland

Not only is there a new bar from [Meridian Pint](http://www.dcbeer.com/news/team-behind-meridian-pint-smoke-barrel-open-brookland) coming to Brookland, but maybe a new [coffee shop/bike shop](http://dc.eater.com/archives/2014/01/21/coffee-in-brookland.php) from Filter and The Bike Rack. And the bike ride to school next year is primarily on the MBT, and Gremlin 1 could definitely bike it next fall. Maybe even Gremlin 2.

It's definitely looking like a more appealing place to live every day.
