In 2018, I biked 3,213 miles. About two thirds of that was on the longtail cargo bike, and much of THAT was hauling the kids as the three of us bumped up against the weight limit of the bike. I was in pretty fantastic shape for a guy who had just turned 40.

Enter 2019. March 8th, I tore my Achilles. It wouldn't be until July 5th that I rode a bike again. In the meantime, the kids were growing and growing and I was really no longer able to haul both of them for any distance, even if they wanted me to, which they increasingly did not. Then 2020 came around and COVID took away most of my motivation to bike - who wants to ride somewhere when you can't go inside?

My strategy to deal with all of this and keep my fitness level was to pretend it wasn't happening, and this clearly isn't working. I've tried nothing, and it isn't working.

I've always been pretty good about keeping up with fitness so long as it didn't take any real time out of my day. Now that I have to work at it, it's not going so well.
