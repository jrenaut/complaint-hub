The kids are super excited for the snow today. They're calling for 4-8 inches. These kids have really never had a good snow. They were either too young or not yet born for Snowmaggeddon and we've been setting records in the DC area over the last couple years for our lack of snow. 

Unfortunately, The Wife and I both have work we have to do, even though OPM closed the federal government. And I have to get a bike ride in for [Freezing Saddles](http://www.freezingsaddles.com). 

Also, for the record, it is nearly 9AM and The Wife is still in bed. I've already been to the gym, made coffee, done some work, and fed the kids breakfast.
