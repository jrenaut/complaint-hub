Sweet, [a wearable fitness tracker for your pet](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/otto-petcare-systems-for-dogs-and-cats). And as I write this it's about to get funded.

I hope one of their cloud services is to text you when your pet is exercising and you aren't. "Hey lazy the dog is going for a walk and you haven't moved in an hour, maybe you should get off the couch and join her".
