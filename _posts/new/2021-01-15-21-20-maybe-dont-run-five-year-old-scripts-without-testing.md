So maybe in the future I should remind myself that mindlessly running a script you haven't touched in 5+ years without bothering to back up your old blog is not exactly a smart decision. I think I've gotten things maybe 75% fixed, but it's likely that the URLs aren't the same as they used to be, so any old links from old blogs are probably dead. Good thing no one writes or reads blogs anymore. 

Anyway, thinking of getting back into blogging again. I like to write. I'm not terrible at it, even if the bulk of the content on this blog suggests otherwise. It's a great time to be blogging since no one cares about the medium anymore. Maybe I'll have these auto-post to Instagram so the kids will see it and ignore it there instead of ignoring it here.
