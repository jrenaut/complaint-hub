I love Google Voice. I love that it transcribes my voicemails and doesn't make me sign in to something to check them and make the notifications disappear. But sometimes a machine isn't the best option for transcription.

Especially when the voicemail is from the kids' school, and the Google Transcription Bots are trying to write Spanish words as English. Not translate them, mind you. Just take the words spoken in Spanish and assume that the speaker just doesn't enunciate well.

Here are some of my favorite examples.

* It's A. M on the buttercup. If you'd like to know your screen, or you can is gonna be included in it.
