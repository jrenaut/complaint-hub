Since January 1st, I've been taking part in the [Bike Arlington Freezing Saddles challenge](http://freezingsaddles.com/). It's a friendly contest that members of the [Bike Arlington forum](http://bikearlingtonforum.com/) have organized (this is the second year of the challenge).

The rules are simple. Everyone is broken up into teams. You get 10 points for every day you ride at least a mile, and a point for every mile. Most team points wins. There are also a bunch of other prizes for random things to keep it interesting for those teams that don't really have a shot at winning.

As I type this we have 11 riders with over 500 miles in January and two with over 1,000. I'm pretty happy with my total - I've ridden every day this month, a total of 253 miles. And yes, every day includes the -5 wind chill and every day of the snow.

It's a cool competition. My team is doing well, but we're not going to win. We're currently pretty solidly in 5th place out of ten teams. But it's a great excuse not only to get out and ride, but also to get to know some fellow forum members a bit better. And the competion finishes with the end of winter at a big happy hour where prizes are given and merriment is had. 

It's defintely good to have an understanding wife who stays with the kids while I go ride on the weekends. Not that she had it so bad today - when I got back she was dozing on the couch while the kids played. Today I rode around Brookland, one of the neighborhoods we're considering when we finally buy a bigger place. I'm not sure I love it - it feels really suburban. Not unpleasant, but there's defintely not as much you can walk to as there is here in Columbia Heights. Good hill workout, though, if you're looking for that.
