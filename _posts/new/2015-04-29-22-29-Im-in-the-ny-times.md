title: I'm in the New York Times!

I'm quoted in an article in the New York Times about [family biking] (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/style/families-ditch-cars-for-cargo-bikes.html?smid=tw-nytimes&_r=0 "Families Ditch Cars for Cargo Bikes"). Full disclosure - the author has kids at our kids' school, and we've talked before about bikes, so it's not like someone randomly found me and realized I was awesome or anything like that.

And I was in the Washington Post earlier this year, though purely by chance, and not in the online edition. A photographer got a picture of me taking the girls home from school and it was used in an article about DC charter schools because I happened to be passing by one when he snapped the photo.

I'm trying to decide what paper would really complete the trifecta. The Boston Globe, to keep up the East Coast thing? The LA Times to really branch out? Maybe a Chicago paper? I'm pulling for LA because, really, how the heck would I get into an LA paper?

Also, a note on the article - the author is aware that there are only quotes from men. What she submitted had quotes from women, and they didn't make the final. I can't speak to why that is, and I'm honestly not sure whether it's better that the NYT editor did it on purpose, or that they are just that clueless. Either way, it's absurd to ingore the women who are embracing cargo bikes instead of minivans. Anecdotally, I know more women who do it than men.
