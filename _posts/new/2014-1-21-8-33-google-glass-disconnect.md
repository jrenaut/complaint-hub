Surely you've seen stuff written about "Glassholes", early Google Glass users who don't deal well with those who are upset by Glass and the feeling that they're always being watched. I'm sure there are people being ridiculous on both sides - some Glass users who should be more sensitive to those around them, and some non-users who immediately jump to the worst possible conclusions.

What people have to understand is that, first, stuff like Google Glass isn't going away, no matter how many coffee shops ban them with snarky notes. And, more importantly, none of us have any idea what is going to come out of projects like this. In some cases, [it's going to be saved lives](http://gigaom.com/2014/01/21/watch-this-firefighter-creating-google-glass-app-to-help-save-lives/).

>Patrick Jordan isn’t just a Google Glass Explorer; he’s a firefighter and a developer based in North Carolina. That combination is making for an impressive idea: Jordan is working on a Glass app that could help him and fellow firefighters save more lives. The software would provide instant heads-up information such as floor plans, locations of nearby hydrants and vehicle data.

Yes, the always-on cameras can be dangerous to privacy, and people need to keep that in mind and remember that being polite and respecting others doesn't depend on the technology one is or isn't using. But we're still in the earliest stages of this technology, and we're already getting glimpses of what it can do for society. There will be growing pains, but you can't think any sort of bans are going to do anything meaningful in the long run. We have to figure out how things like Google Glass are going to fit into society.
