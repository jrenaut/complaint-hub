I have to admit that I watch very little TV these days. What I do watch is usually through our Roku, which I love. But I can't help seeing these articles on [putting Roku hardware into tvs](http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/06/sharp-roku-tvs/?ncid=rss_truncated "Engadget - Sharp will start making HDTVs with Roku built-in"), I can't help thinking about TVs with built in VHS. Media players are always obsolete faster than TVs. Even the whole concept of a "smart TV" is kind of silly. I get it from a marketing perspective, but I really can't understand what consumer would want this.
