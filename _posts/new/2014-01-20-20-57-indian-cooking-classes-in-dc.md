title: Indian Cooking Classes in DC
tags: [cooking, dc]

I just backed a cool project on Kickstarter - [Pansaari](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/934396646/indian-grocerychaicooking-classesin-dupont-tis-tim). The project is close to being funded, but is running out of time. It sounds pretty great.

>A communal space offering food that is good for you. Sip chai, browse books, take a cooking class, buy spices, local produce, and more.

I'm especially interested in the cooking classes. As you may know, we're mostly vegetarian here (though The Wife eats seafood and I eat pretty much anything, just not at home), and there are a ton of good vegetarian options in Indian cooking. Plus some spicy stuff. I'm on a big spicy kick these days.

Anyway, I hope they reach their goal.
