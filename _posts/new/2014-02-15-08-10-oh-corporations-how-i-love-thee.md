[ESPN - Goodell made $44.2 million in '12](http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/10457530/roger-goodell-nfl-commissioner-made-442-million-2012)

Roger Goodell got paid $44 million dollars in 2012 to manage a non-profit with revenue of $10 billion. I won't argue he's not worth that, because I have no idea and don't really care. But it shows how out of whack everything is. 

It's also a little annoying that everywhere you see this revenue number attached to "the NFL", but it's not clear whether they mean the NFL as in the non-profit corporation, or the for-profit (mostly) teams that make up the NFL. This is significant because that's a huge amout of tax revenue that is or isn't being paid.
