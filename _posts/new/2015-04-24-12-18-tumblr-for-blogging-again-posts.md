I'm going to try to start blogging again for the millionth time. I really do enjoy blogging, I just get distracted, and it's tough to actually do it from work, which is where I tend to get the ideas for blog posts. This time you know I'm serious, though, because I set a reminder on my phone to start blogging agian.

Over/Under on posts before I forget about this again is three.
