[ESPN - Redskins' Taylor dies from injury in shooting - NFL](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3129406)

> "I just take this job very seriously," Taylor said in a rare group interview during training camp. "It's almost like, you play a kid's game for a king's ransom. And if you don't take it serious enough, eventually one day you're going to say, 'Oh, I could have done this, I could have done that.'"

I really do feel bad for his family and friends.  Who ever knows if everyone is just saying good things about him because he's gone, but all the quotes from his teammates say he really was growing up now that he had a little girl.  All the personal fouls, the spitting on other players, the guns and DUIs, that was supposedly behind him.  I'd like to believe that. 

I'm afraid, though, that we're going to find out that the guy came not to rob him, but intended the whole time to shoot him, and it was because of something that Taylor did.  The reports of burglary are too vague and don't really sound plausible.  But I don't know. 

I hope his 18-month-old daughter doesn't remember this when she grows up.
