[Metroblogging DC: Metro Unveils New Online Station Maps Powered By Google](http://dc.metblogs.com/archives/2007/07/metro_unveils_n.phtml)

> Metro's unveiled new online maps for their stations, which include local business listings, all powered by Google Maps.

Well, not exactly. I mean, they still have all their vowels, and I don't think they have an AJAX "search as you type" function. But they've finally gotten a decent map. The next step would be to integrate local public transportation search into Google Maps. That would be cool. You could choose driving or walking or riding public transportation when you tried to get directions. They're probably working on it.
