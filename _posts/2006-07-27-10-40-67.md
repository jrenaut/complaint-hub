[CNN.com - Sun kills 60,000 a year, WHO says - Jul 26, 2006](http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/07/26/health.sun.reut/index.html?section=cnn_topstories)

> "The application of sunscreens should not be used to prolong sun exposure but rather to protect the skin when exposure is unavoidable," the report advises.

When the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/en/) tells me to only go outside when absolutely necessary, I stop paying attention.  Sure, we should do more to protect the ozone layer.  But staying inside with the A/C blasting isn't really the way to go.

I'm too lazy to look up numbers, but I imagine that 60,000 people a year makes the sun about as dangerous as a pair of toenail clippers.  How many people are there in the world?  Four billion?  What percentage of four billion is 60,000?  Well, I'll tell you.  It's 0.0015%.  You're more likely to be struck by lightning while being mauled by a bear and holding a winning lottery ticket.  Actually, I made that up.  But seriously.  More people die from heart disease because they stayed inside worrying about skin cancer than die from actually getting skin cancer.  I made that up, too, but I guarantee it's true or your money back.
