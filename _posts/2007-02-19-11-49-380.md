> Anyway, every guy should know basic garbage disposal maintenance. You never know when your wife will spill half a can of Quaker Oats in her purse on the way home from work, then dump a penny down the disposal as sheâ€™s cleaning it out.

Awesome.  Someone found this entry searching Google for "remove penny from garbage disposal".  I hope I helped him or her out.

I love looking through my referrals and search term results.  It would be even cooler if I had more visitors.  But it makes me happy that searching for "whatever" + "complaint" often brings people to me.
