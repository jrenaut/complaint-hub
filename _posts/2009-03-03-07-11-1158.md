For whatever reason, it's never easy to find this information, so maybe I got lucky. I have no idea if this link will work beyond today, but [the Washington DC DPW says street cleaning will resume on March 23, 2009](http://app.calendar.rrc.dc.gov/eventDetail.aspx?thisDate=3.3.2009&eventId=11475&eo=21237). So get ready to start moving your car once a week again.
