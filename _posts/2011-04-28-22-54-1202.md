Oh, what a glorious world we live in. I just contested a ridiculous parking ticket entirely online. I'm not sure how I got the ticket - I never actually saw a ticket on the car. I just got an email telling me that the fine was about to double. So I responded. 

> I never received the paper ticket - my first notification of this ticket was the email that the penalty was doubling. However, I did not commit the violation "STOP/STND IN AM RUSH". Attached please find photos of the signs on both sides of the street. The ticket was issued on 3/29/2011, which you'll note is a Tuesday. According to the signs, there are absolutely no rush hour restrictions on parking on the 1400 block of Harvard St NW on Tuesdays. So it is not possible that this ticket is valid.

I attached two pictures.

I don't know how I got the ticket. But I don't think I'm paying it. I'll let you know if the DMV agrees.
