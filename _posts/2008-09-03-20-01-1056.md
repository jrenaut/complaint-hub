I was just at Target at DCUSA picking up some aluminum foil and some other stuff so we (read: the wife) can cook stuff to freeze for quick post-baby dining. And also so I could cook [some soy-free seitan](http://yeahthatveganshit.blogspot.com/2007/04/infamous-seitan-recipe-o-greatness.html) (Note: URL is not safe for work. At least, if your work doesn't like profanity. It's probably safe, but I just like to warn people just in case). Anyway, school is clearly back in session. The escalator into Target was mobbed, and there were literally thousands of kids running around buying up dorm supplies. Well, maybe not thousands. But a lot. And I love that the vast majority seemed to be coming up the escalators, meaning that they walked or took the Metro rather than driving. Maybe that's more a function of not owning cars than green city living, but I'll take what I can get.
