I'm tired of the way Complaint Hub looks.  I've just been over at [Candy Blog](http://www.typetive.com/candyblog/), run by [Nanowrimo](http://www.nanowrimo.org) big shot Cybele, and I really like the design.  It's not what I'm looking for, but it fits her site really well.  And that's what I want here - a design that fits my site.  Then the question becomes, what sort of a design is right for a blog about complaining?  I don't know.  I'd like to do something myself, but [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) uses [PHP](http://www.php.net), and I have pretty limited PHP experience.  I suppose it would be good to learn.
