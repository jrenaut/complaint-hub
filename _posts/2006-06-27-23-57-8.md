[For Wetter or Worse: A Wanton Excess of Water](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/26/AR2006062601477.html)

The above Washington Post article suffers from a great many [maladies](http://www.webster.com/dictionary/malady). First, alliteration is a nice literary tool, but I think it's better suited to fiction, or perhaps poetry. Second, aside from a few quotes and factoids about the weather, it doesn't have much of a point. "Too much rain can be a bad thing". Yeah, thanks for the bulletin. At least we were spared some remark about drought in other countries.

Third, and most importantly, I'm a little bitter about the weather already, and reading an article like this (I know, I could have skipped it) doesn't help. I'm not sure if we've broken any records in the DC area these past few days, but I've lived in and around the area my whole life, and I don't remember anything like this.

The article also mentions [Al Gore,](http://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/GlobalWarming/story?id=2110628&page=1) in the news lately for finally showing that he has a soul (A little late for the Democratic party, who maybe invested some time and money in him a while back).  It doesn't actually come out and say that the rain is a direct result of the global warming that Gore's been talking about, but I think it's clear what we're supposed to infer.

Anyway, I lost my point long ago.  I just wish it would stop raining.
