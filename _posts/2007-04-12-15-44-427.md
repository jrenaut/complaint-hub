[![I LOVE HOT MOMS](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/232/445449689_8c4aaab462_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/445449689/)

It appears that Flickr users, despite whatever claims they might make to the contrary, are really looking for pictures of hot women, probably in various stages of undress. Witness the photo here, which in a mere 11 days has already become the most viewed photo I have on Flickr. I have 1,951 other photos on Flickr. The first one was posted February 25th, 2005. Many of them are of greater artistic quality than this one.

Y ou may wonder, from looking at the photo, why it's so popular. One only has to look at the title, "I LOVE HOT MOMS", and the tags, which include "hot", "hotmoms" and "NOLA".

For shame, Flickr users. For shame.
