The guy who lives upstairs in my building must be protecting my car from harm. Since moving into the building in January, he's had his convertible top cut. He had a window broken. He's been ticketed numerous times, and towed at least twice. And last night, a hit-and-run left the whole side of his car smashed. 

Now, some might argue that he has a parking spot in back that he doesn't always use. Some would probably have a point. But I like to think that his car is a little magic talisman that attracts minor disaster, leaving my car protected from all evil. Well, I have had a few bumper taps from people parking. But that's an accepted part of living in the city.

I worry about what's going to happen when the new condos at the Columbia Heights Metro station open up. It's already crowded here, and that's undoubtedly going to make parking a nightmare. Zipcar gets more appealing every day.
