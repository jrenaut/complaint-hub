So how's this for a great Friday evening: I'm sitting on the couch. To my left, the windows are open because it's a gorgeous spring evening. Right next to me on the couch, the wife is napping, waiting for the Celtics game. I have a kitchen full of beer and wine left over from my birthday party last week. We have the ingredients ready for dinner, pasta with tomatoes and asparagus, plus some [cauliflower poppers](http://vegweb.com/index.php?topic=18457.0). In front of me is my brand new work computer, on which I've just installed [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/), which everyone should install on their Windows machine. It's similar to [Gnome-Do](http://do.davebsd.com/) for Linux and Quicksilver for Mac - I've been using Gnome-Do for a while and I love it, and wanted something like it for my Windows work machine. And speaking of Linux, my personal laptop is currently downloading and upgrading to the latest version of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com), Hardy Heron. So, I have sports, food and drink, computer geekishness, and my fabulous wife. I have no idea what more I could possibly want.
