[Bush faces angry, dissatisfied electorate in speech - CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/23/bush.sotu/index.html?eref=rss_topstories)

> Two-thirds of respondents say that Bush has done something to make them angry -- a figure that has grown six points since last year and 16 points since Bush's State of the Union in 2004.

I've kind of gotten away from talking about politics here for a couple of reasons.  One, the letdown after the election - after focusing on politics so much leading up to the election, I was kind of burned out.  I know, really rough for me.  The second was that I was afraid that the constant beating my head against a wall was going to cause permanent damage.

In any event, I should get back into politics.  Just because it's not making news now like it was in October doesn't mean that nothing important is going on.
