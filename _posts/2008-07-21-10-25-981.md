> Until Sunday, July 27, you can download all the novels and wallpapers that were given away in our recent "Watch the Skies" program--for free. Don't delay! 

Now they're gleefully boasting that the carrot they held out to encourage people to sign up early is available to everyone. I know, I could have been reading all those stories I downloaded before everyone else, and it's not Tor's fault that there are no good ebook readers. But I really can't figure out why they wanted people to sign up early. And now that all the free stuff is available to everyone, I can't even gloat about how I got it first. What a bunch of jerks.
