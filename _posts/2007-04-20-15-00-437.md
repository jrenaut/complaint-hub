The [teaser site](http://www.scriptfrenzy.org/) for the new project from the people who brought you [National Novel Writing Month](http://www.nanowrimo.org) is up.  I think I'm going to try this new one.  The goal, instead of a 50,000 word novel in November, is a 20,000 word script in June.

I've never written a script before.  And I never got around to reading the script for Die Hard, which I'm told by [someone who should know](http://gmoore.net/) that it's the de facto guide to writing a good script.  Or maybe a good action movie script.  Whatever.

I think it will be fun.  If you have suggestions for a movie, let me know.  If the suggestion in some way involves a duck, so much the better.
