[Edwards quits!](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7217838.stm)

>  He lost Iowa's caucuses, came third in New Hampshire, admitted getting his "butt kicked" in Nevada and came third in his native South Carolina.

Hooray!  John Edwards finally woke up to the fact that America doesn't want him to be President!  He should have done it a while ago, and he definitely should have done it when he failed to win his home state, but whatever.  He's out now, and we can concentrate on the two people who actually do have a chance of winning.

Here's hoping he follows Ted Kennedy and endorses Obama.
