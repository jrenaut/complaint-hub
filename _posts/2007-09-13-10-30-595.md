[Nikon D300 Hands-On Preview: 1. Introduction: Digital Photography Review](http://www.dpreview.com/previews/nikond300/)

51-point autofocus? Are they kidding me? My D100 has 5. This thing even has the live preview that digital point-and-shoots have had all along, but DSLRs haven't because of that pesky mirror thing. And 8 frames per second when you use the battery pack or A/C adapter.

Now, I have absolutely no need for a new camera. But this thing is pretty hot. 

> We knew Nikon couldn't wait too long before implementing some kind of automatic sensor cleaning system, and so the D300 becomes the first Nikon with such a feature. It works in the same manner as other implementations, piezoelectric elements vibrate a cover filter which should in theory remove any light dust particles attached to it.

That may be the best part about it. My one and only complaint about the D100 is the difficulty in getting dust off the chip. I think it's a manufacturing problem they had with the D100s that allows dust on there in the first place, but I've had mine cleaned a few times, and I keep getting dust.

Anyway, I want one. The wife wants to steal the D100, so maybe we can come to some sort of agreement. . .
