[Volkswagen to Introduce 70 mpg Diesel-Electric Hybrid Golf](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/02/volkswagen_to_i.php)

Okay, I don't care about the Jetta and the Rabbit, but a 70 MPG Audi A3 is really, really hot. I've loved the A3 ever since I first saw one, walking from the train station in London to the house where my sister-in-law and her family were living. We passed an Audi dealer, and every time we went by, there were a couple of A3s sitting out front (Sexy right-hand-drive models, of course). I was thrilled when they decided to bring them over to the States, and now am even more thrilled at the prospect of 70 MPG. Especially if we can get some nice biodiesel stations in the area (I know, fat chance, but I'm dreaming here). Now I just have to convince the wife that 1) We need a new car 2) We can afford an Audi and 3) We can't afford NOT to get a biodiesel hybrid Audi. Any suggestions?
