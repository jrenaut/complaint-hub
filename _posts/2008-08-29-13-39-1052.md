I hate to bring this up again, but Wolf Blitzer was worse last night than he has been previously. They were talking about Obama's acceptance speech, which I thought was excellent. The confetti and fireworks were over, and someone on stage started some sort of closing prayer. Now, I'm not a religious person. And I don't like mixing religion and politics. But if people are praying, you should be respectful. And most of the CNN talking heads were - someone suggested that they all shut up for a minute. That lasted for all of two or three seconds before Wolf started talking again! And about nothing! He was sending everyone to CNN.com for more information. Wolf Blitzer needs to be reminded every single day that anyone with good enunciation can do his job. Just because he's well known does not mean that he's important. The day robots can read cue cards is the day that Wolf Blitzer is redundant.
