And there's [another](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/09/26/walmart-shutting-dow.html) in the [long](http://techdirt.com/articles/20080422/234401923.shtml) [list](/blog/where-microsoft-went-yahoo-will-follow) of music retailers who decided to turn off their DRM servers, effectively taking back the music you "bought".

WalMart is actually telling people to burn their DRMed music to cd so they don't lose it. This is a pretty callous way of telling customers that WalMart doesn't care about them. I don't really understand how there can't be a better solution. Is it really that hard for WalMart to leave a server running that just always says, "yes, you're authorized"? It is increasingly clear to all those paying attention that any business model that depends on some sort of DRM is doomed to fail. And those who buy DRMed goods are doomed to lose them when the seller decides not to support it anymore. Let that be a lesson - DRM is anti-consumer. Always. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either mislead or lying.
