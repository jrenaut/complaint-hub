So the Mitchell Report is out, as I'm sure you all know.  The only current Oriole on there, I think, is Brian Roberts.  I've always liked Brain Roberts.  He's a little tiny second baseman who gets on base a lot.

I suppose we should have seen this coming - his yearly OPS numbers are .625, .605, .704, .720, .902, .757, .809.  Does one of those numbers look, perhaps, way higher than the rest of them?

The year his bat exploded, 2005, is also the year he started wearing the [Nike MaxSight](http://www.visionsalon.com/nikemaxsight.stm) contact lenses, which could explain it.  The Mitchell Report simply states that former Oriole Larry Bigbie said that Roberts told him that he took steroids "once or twice" in 2003.

It figures:  after I call for releasing all the Orioles on the list, one of my favorite players is the only guy who would get released.  At least it wasn't Bedard.
