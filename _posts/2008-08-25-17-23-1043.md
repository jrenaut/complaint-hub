What is going on with the news today? I don't usually read mainstream news sources, figuring that if it's important, either someone's blog will mention it, the wife will mention it, or my office-mate will read about it in the Express. But today, my RSS feed was so devoid of anything interesting that I went to [the Washington Post website](http://www.washingtonpost.com) to see if anything interesting had happened. Almost the entire front page is dedicated to whatever Obama is going to do tonight, and I just can't get myself to care. I made up my mind long ago that I was voting for him. And at this point, he would pretty much have to tear off his face and reveal himself as a chupacabra or space alien or something to get me to change my mind.

Actually, I would vote for either of those ahead of McCain so long as they promised to try and undo some of the damage to the country that Bush and Co. have done. And listening to the news anchors talk about President Chupacabra would be fun, too. I think I also can't get interested because I just can't (or maybe won't) imagine how McCain could possibly win. I may be naive. Considering the lukewarm response to his "I forget how many houses I own" remark, coming during the lowest point in the real estate market in my adult lifetime, it's a strong possibility. Anyway, I suppose we'll watch some of whatever is going on tonight. Maybe it will even be interesting. And maybe tomorrow the news will be back to normal.
