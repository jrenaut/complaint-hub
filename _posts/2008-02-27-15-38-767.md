I finally tried out [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com). If you don't know, it's kind of like customized internet radio. You tell them artists you like, and it plays them, plus other stuff it thinks you'll like. I'm still tweaking the station - at the moment it's playing nothing but Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson. Now, I like both of them, but I'm trying to find some new music, not just listen to stuff I already like. Crap, now it's playing Ministry. I'm not sure what I've done wrong - it seems to think that I'm really angry now. Quick, what's a happy band that doesn't suck?
