So I'm converting to Drupal. I have most of the basics working. I'm not sure my .htaccess redirect from the old site is working. It might just take the server some time to figure it out, I don't know. I know the RSS feed is updated. If you've been reading the feed, it should be basically a transparent change. It's pretty cool so far. Of course, everything gets messed up when I upgrade to Drupal 6, but they aren't quite ready for the full release yet (Contrary to what it say on their site). Anyway, it's late, so I'm probably just about done for now, but keep watching. More cool stuff is coming.
