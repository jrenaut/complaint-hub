I was reading [this movie review](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2009/03/28/quick-review-monsters-vs-aliens/), and had no idea who Harold Faltermeyer was. So, I did what any normal person would do, and Googled him. His [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Faltermeyer) offers up a serving of the English language that just made my day. 

> [The theme from Top Gun and the theme from Beverly Hills Cop are] both often imitated, highly influential instrumental hits that to some extent practically redefined action film scoring in the '80s

Read that fragment a few times and just bask in its glory.
