The official due date has come and gone, and the house is still baby-free. That's okay, because it's perfectly normal for first-time mothers to be late. However, it's not okay, because the wife would really like to be done with this whole pregnancy thing. And I'd really like to meet our kid. We're not quite at the "spicy food and pineapple" stage, or any of the other crazy techniques to entice the kid to come out. For all you parents out there - did you do anything to get the kid to come out? I'd especially like to hear things that 1) worked and 2) are fun for me. Like, if you went out to a really nice dinner, maybe? Or I really like the suggestion that pregnant women should clean the floor on their hands and knees because it's a good position to relieve pain from carrying the baby.
