Except that I haven't run in months. My first 10K since my foot surgery was both my worst time ever and a great success. My official time was 57:48, a 9:18 pace, which is well off my personal best of 49:38, but that personal best was in April, and since then I've had foot surgery and run less than 20 miles total, I don't think this was so bad. It was frustrating to be so slow, and to not have that extra bit at the end. But after more than five months of almost no running, I expected it. I like the course - it's at [West Potomac Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Potomac_Park), just south of the Mall, and right on the water. It's flat and wide and scenic. The [Run Geek Run 8K](http://www.rungeekrun.net/) is going to be at the same place in a few weeks, and I'm thinking about running it, but I know I won't have much of a chance to run between now and then, so I won't do much better than I did this weekend.
