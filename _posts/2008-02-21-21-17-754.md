[Bell's Brewery: Brands](http://www.bellsbeer.com/index.php/brands.html)

I stopped in Whole Foods to pick up some dinner (Salmon and asparagus, at the wife's request), and saw they had a Bell's brand I'd never seen - the [Consecrator Dopplebock](http://www.bellsbeer.com/index.php?c=product_info&content=19).  It's still getting cold in the fridge, so I can't give a review yet, but Bell's crappy new website calls it "a well balanced, full bodied beer".  It turns out it's only available in February, and not even the whole month.

I feel sorry for my West Coast brothers-in-law, both lovers of Bell's, who can't get it locally.

I have to say, it's more fun to drink a beer with a cool name.  I mean, Consecrator Dopplebock?  That's awesome.  It's up there with Rogue Dead Guy Ale (A great beer) and Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre (Another great beer).
