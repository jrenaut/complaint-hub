[Bush's New Tack Steers Clear of 'Stay the Course' - washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/23/AR2006102301053.html?nav=rss_email/components)

> But the White House is cutting and running from "stay the course."

Oh, how clever.  Use the phrase that the Republicans use to attack Democrats and then the phrase the Republicans used before the Democrats used it to attack Republicans.  Where does one go for neutral news reporting?  I get Fox News at the gym.  Fair and balanced, they say.  Yes, fair to radical conservative nutjobs, and balanced between Republicans and other Republicans.  I tried Daily Kos, because that's one of the first names in political blogging news.  If you take Daily Kos, and reverse the adjectives - that is, replace "bad" with "good" and all that, you have Fox News all over again.  I tried the Wall Street Journal, but they hide behind a pay wall, and I don't want to get a subscription.  The Washington Post can't possibly claim to be unbiased after allowing a line like the one above to be printed. Where do you get your news?
