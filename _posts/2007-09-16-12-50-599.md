[Q & A with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails | Herald Sun](http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21741980-5006024,00.html) Via [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net)

> And I just said "That's the most insulting thing I've heard. I've garnered a core audience that you feel it's OK to rip off? F--- you'. That's also why you don't see any label people here, 'cos I said 'F--- you people. Stay out of my f---ing show. If you wanna come, pay the ticket like anyone else. F--- you guys". They're thieves. I don't blame people for stealing music if this is the kind of s--- that they pull off.

Great interview with Trent Reznor, who has the fanbase and the morals to tell the record companies that he'd really just like to make his music available to his fans at a reasonable price. If I hadn't already bought his latest cd, I'd go buy it right now.

Perhaps the coolest part is that he's planning to ditch conventional recording as soon as his contract is up. The more people who follow him, the fewer people who are going to get turned into criminals for [trying to use an iPod on a Linux box](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/156634761/new-ipods-reengineer.html), or maybe copy a cd they've purchased for their own personal use.

I still remember the first time I saw the video for "Head Like a Hole" on MTV.  I've bought every full release he's put out since then, and most of the remix albums and whatnot.  I'll pre-order the next one whether or not I've heard anything off it.

Anyway, I'm really glad he's trying to balance making money with trying to get his music to his fans.

As an aside, you may notice that I've linked to another post from Cory Doctorow at BoingBoing.  Despite my post the other day, he does write some interesting stuff, and he's generally on the right side of things.
