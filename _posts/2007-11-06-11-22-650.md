title: Nano Update -  Day 6 (Or, the worst paragraph Ive ever written)
url: ch/673.html

I wrote 353 words this morning.  That's good for the wordcount, but today's opening paragraph is one of the worst I've written since I started doing [Nano](http://www.nanowrimo.org). 

> Kathy woke up feeling cold.  Her leg hurt, and she was cold.  As she regained her bearings, she realized that it was very noisy.  People screaming and running everywhere.

WTF was that?  I looked at it as I was counting words after I got to work, and I cringed.  I'm going to claim that I was still asleep when I wrote that, because that's the only reasonable excuse.  I know Nano is supposed to create more quantity than quality, but there IS a bottom, below which one should take up another hobby.  That paragraph was below the bottom.  But the section picked up as it went on, and I have high hopes for this afternoon's ride home.

I think I'm going to use that paragraph as my excerpt at the Nano site.
