[Beltway Toll Plan May Need Va. Funds - washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/22/AR2006102201081.html?nav=rss_email/components)

No, but you can hope that a plan that you agreed to doesn't go $100 million over budget. The sequence of events seems to have gone like this: 

  * Private industry says, "We can make an [HOT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_lane) lane without using any taxpayer money, thereby easing congestion and making a profit!"
  * Virginia government says, "Sweet, go for it, dude."
  * Private industry says, "Oops, when we said 'no taxpayer money', we really meant '$100 million in taxpayer money'. Our bad."
  * Virginia government says, "Looks like you're not the tooth fairy! Here's some cash."
Great. It probably won't even help traffic.
