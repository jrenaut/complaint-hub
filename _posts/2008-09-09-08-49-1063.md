Just got back from the podiatrist - I am completely medically cleared to run, jump, dance, and generally frolic about on my surgically repaired foot. If you are looking for a podiatrist in the DC area, I highly recommend [Dr. Ian Beiser](http://www.ianbeiserdpm.com/). Every aspect of my experience with him and his practice was excellent, and I will definitely go back next time I'm in need of podiatric (is that a word? Firefox doesn't think so, but Firefox's dictionary is often a bit lacking.) services. That means I can play flag football this weekend if I'm up to it, and I can slowly start getting ready for my 10K next month (Although with about 30 days to go, I can't imagine I'm going to be all that prepared). But there's no baby yet. The wife has an appointment today, and maybe they'll have something insightful to tell us, but as far as I know we're just waiting. We have until September 24th before they'll induce her, and I think that will be plenty of time. I've been trying to tell the kid about how great it is out here, but it doesn't seem convinced.
