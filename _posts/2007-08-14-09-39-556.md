Seriously, I've had it with the four car trains. Someone at WMATA needs to get it through their head that you can't send a four car train ANYWHERE during peak commuting times. I didn't even have space to read the Economist. How am I supposed to be informed if I can't read on the Metro?

I don't know if it's a money thing. I suspect it is. It probably won't really work to raise prices. They're already pretty high. A tax to shift the burden to people who don't actually ride Metro would be nice. If people want to drive in the city, that's fine, but they're going to subsidize those of us who avoid it as much as possible.

Anyway, it's a crummy way to start the day.
