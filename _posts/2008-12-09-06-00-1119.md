The only reason we still have a car is my daughter's car seat. It's just not worth the hassle in the city. Sometime Sunday night, someone came down our street and slashed or deflated a bunch of car tires, including one of ours. I don't see a visible puncture, but I find it pretty hard to believe that someone actually removed the cap, let the air out, and took the time to screw the cap back on. It could have been worse - we need new tires anyway - but it's a huge hassle. I'm going to have to call [AAA](http://www.aaa.com) because the [Mazda dealer](http://www.rosenthalnissanmazda.com/) managed to lose the wheel lock key last time I was in for an oil change, back when they were still doing them for free. So I can't change the tire myself. I was thinking about this - if I were the vandal, I would actually take the time and let the air out and replace the cap. I think that's way funnier, and it doesn't cause any damage, so you don't get in as much trouble if you get caught. Mindless vandalism lacks style. Do I need to file a police report? Half the street got a tire slashed, and I know at least a couple of my neighbors reported it. Our insurance deductible is more than the cost of a tire, so we probably won't report it to them, either. Doesn't seem like it's worth the trouble.
