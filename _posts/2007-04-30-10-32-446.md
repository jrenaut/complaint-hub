[Washington Post: Eastern Market: What We've Lost](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2007/04/eastern_market_what_weve_lost.html)

It's all over the news, so you've likely heard, but Eastern Market burned down last night. I'm very glad that I finally made it out there for the first time a few weeks ago. I don't think I could hope to retain my DC resident status, [parking tickets](http://columbiaheights.complainthub.com/articles/2007/04/19/i-think-im-officially-a-dc-resident-now) notwithstanding, if I had never been to Eastern Market. 

My fear now is that it won't be rebuilt without some kind of "anchor store", like a chain grocery or a Starbucks. That would certainly ruin some of the feel of the market. I can't claim to be a regular visitor, or claim any nostalgia at the market being part of my life, so it's hard for me to talk about the feel of the market. But even my one visit was nice, and I can't imagine it being reborn as something like Dean and Delucca in Georgetown.
