I expect this sort of thing from Texas. I mean, what does "Texas Democrat" even mean? I think it's like [dark matter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) - something we think might exist, and we've seen evidence that it might exist, but no on has really ever seen it. But I expected better out of Ohio. I always figured Ohio was a sensible state. I mean, Cleveland just screams "sensible". Let me tell you this, Ohio - Hillary doesn't love you. She used you, like she used New York to get her into this race. She used you to take away some of Obama's momentum. And now that she's done it, she's going to be insufferable for the next few weeks. But no matter. Obama will be our next President, and things will get better.
