title: Why do I hate roller bags at work?

I am annoyed (probably irrationally, I know) by people who use the little roller bags instead of a briefcase or something at work. I'm not quite sure why I'm annoyed, but I hate them. Every time I see one, I think to myself, "That person thinks he/she is more important than he/she is". I'm okay with roller bags when traveling, although I don't really like to use them myself - they make too much noise and they bug me. But I see the utility, and occasionally even use them. Maybe if they had rubber wheels . . . Anyway, part of my irritation was the gentleman using the restroom on my floor who had left his roller bag in a particularly inconvenient spot. But it goes beyond that, and I'm at a loss to explain why. Part of it may be that people tend to be less maneuverable with these bags. They expand their personal space, sometimes infringing on mine in the elevator (And we all know [I don't like elevators](taxonomy/term/53)). But I don't think that fully explains it, because I don't even like to see people far away from me with these bags. Any ideas? Do YOU like roller bags at work?
