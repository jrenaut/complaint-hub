We're always looking for new places to stop for coffee during the kid's morning nap - about two hours after she gets up in the morning, she'll usually sleep for an hour and a half or two if you stick her in her stroller and walk her around for a while. This weekend, we tried two new places. Saturday morning we went to [Locolat Cafe](http://www.belgiumlocolat.com/) at 18th and Florida NW. I guess this is considered Adams Morgan, but I'm not entirely sure. We had brunch - the wife tried the savory waffles, which were great, and I had a turkey and cheese on croissant, which was also very good. The coffee was good, if expensive. And because they forgot to charge us for an item and had to run the credit card twice, they gave us a little chocolate-covered meringue. As an aside, it is almost always good business to give away something small when you've inconvenienced your customer. It was barely an inconvenience at all, but when the cashier (I believe she's actually the manager and wife of the chef) says, in effect, "I messed up, let me make it up to you", I will be back. Sunday, we went to [Cafe 1612](http://www.healthbardc.com/contacthealthbar.html). We were planning to go to [Love Cafe](http://www.cakelove.com/lovecafe/), but they don't open until ten, and the kid needed her nap before that. 1612 was good, but it shares a building (but not any walls, apparently) with a gym. It's a little strange to eat brunch while watching the girl fold towels at the counter. But the service was good, the food was good, and the coffee was not only good but reasonably priced. The music there was a little funny - it was an oldies station that didn't really fit the decor of the place. We've now got quite a list of places to go and get coffee. [Heller's](http://www.hellersbakery.com/) is probably my favorite because of their egg and cheese bagels, but it's always nice to have variety.
