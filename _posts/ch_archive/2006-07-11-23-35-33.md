[Newsvine - Political Strategists to Launch Web Site](http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/07/11/284742-political-strategists-to-launch-web-site)

Well, not quite all my life.  Looks like "Matthew Dowd, chief strategist for the Bush-Cheney campaign in 2004, and Joe Lockhart, former White House press secretary under President Clinton" are starting up an "Internet information venture designed to interact with America's opinion leaders and serve as an antidote to the right-left clash that typifies political discourse on the Web".    


It's supposed to be a social networking site for grownups.  And it's supposed to be bipartisan, focusing on informed debate rather than the self-serving crap we get from the Democrats and Republicans now.

It remains to be seen if it will be anything worthwhile, but I would love to see this work out.  Imagine!  A place to get real information from both sides of our political spectrum.

Anyway, keep your eye out in October for [HotSoup](http://www.hotsoup.com)
