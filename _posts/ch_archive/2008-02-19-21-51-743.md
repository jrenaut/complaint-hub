I'm thinking about migrating the site from [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) to [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org). For many of you, that sentence may make absolutely no sense. If you don't keep reading, I won't blame you. If you do stop reading, you should make it up to me by going and buying [John Scalzi's special edition book](http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=395) that he's auctioning off for charity. Get him to inscribe it to me, with some really inscrutable saying. Bid quickly, as it's already over $2000.

Anyway, if you're still reading, I got a little infatuated with Drupal while doing some work for a project that never panned out. It doesn't do blogging as well as WordPress (At least not right out of the box), but it does a lot of other stuff much better. And I think it would be perfect for a project I've been thinking about.

Some of you may know that I'm MUCH better at thinking about projects than actually doing them, and I have a bunch of stuff still in the thinking stage. I have a money-making venture with a [friend](http://www.gmoore.net). I have an online economics course to take with another friend. I have the science fiction novel I've been plotting out. I have an [8K](http://www.runwashington.com/other/stpat02list.html) in March and a [10K](http://stopcsa.org/Race/) in April. I have my real job. I also have a wife, and a family, and some friends, all of whom require and deserve some of my time.

In any event, the project could be really cool, and a nice side effect is that I'd probably bring back the complaint submission page that people have been missing. And I'll update the theme of the site - at least one friend insists that his eyes bleed when he reads it.

So that's in the future.  I don't know how long it will take to happen, but be prepared.  If you subscribe via RSS, the feed might change, although hopefully [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com) will take care of that transparently (To you, at least).  But I'll keep you posted.
