[Coke & Nestle Sued Over Enviga's Bogus Calorie Burning Claims - Consumerist](http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/enviga/coke--nestle-sued-over-envigas-bogus-calorie-burning-claims-233284.php)

> Enviga, the so-called "calorie burning soda" has landed Coke and Nestle in some hot water, as the The Center for Science In The Public Interest has filed suit against both for false advertising claims

I've written about [Enviga](http://www.complainthub.com/?p=185) a few times.  I don't like it.  I don't like their claims.  I don't like their carcinogen sweeteners.  I don't like the taste.

But I do like a lawsuit for false advertising.  That's always fun.
