[Empire State Building Seeks Best of the Brightest](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/20/nyregion/21empirecnd.html) via [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/empire-state-building-to-get-new-uglier-lights-254006.php)

> With the new lights, though, the Empire State would be able to feature â€œdynamic new patterns,â€ said James T. Connors, the general manager of the Empire State Building Company.

Just what NYC needs.  A huge, gaudy, brightly colored display.  When this sort of thing is confined to Times Square, it's kind of cool.  I still remember the first time I walked out of the subway into Times Square, and the overwhelming-ness of it all.  To be fair, it was only a few years ago.  But still.

And I'm not a New Yorker.  I love to visit the city, but I don't live there.  But I can't imagine that any New Yorker really wants a huge, animated American Flag waving over the city.

Maybe they'd be better off if they got their own [Anti-Terrorist Pincers of Doom](http://www.airforcememorial.org/design/index.asp) like we did.  Rumor has it that over 30,000 terrorists have already been captured and impaled by the pincers.  How many terrorists has the Empire State Building caught?  That's what I thought.
