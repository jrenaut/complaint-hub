[Weather Forecast Accuracy for Falls Church, Virginia](http://www.forecastadvisor.com/Virginia/FallsChurch/22042) via [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/) This website not only gives you a current forecast, but it also tells you which of the other forecasting sites are most accurate. If you haven't lived under a rock your entire life, you probably know that weather forecasters are generally regarded to be on about the same level as used car salesmen in terms of honesty. I'm often surprised at how angry people get at the weatherman, as if it's his or her fault that either the weather is bad, or that the prediction was off.

What I'm really curious about, though, is how accurate the accuracy-checkers' forecast is.
