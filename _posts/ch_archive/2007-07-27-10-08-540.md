[HIDE YOUR ARMS Â» Teetonic are a bunch of hippies](http://hideyourarms.com/2007/07/27/teetonic-are-a-bunch-of-hippies/)

[Teetonic](http://www.teetonic.com/) is a t-shirt design competition website that has decided to go organic cotton. Not sure if they're using the omnipresent American Apparel organic cotton shirts, but they're using something. I like the American Apparel shirts because they're cut skinny, and if I want to wear some of [my favorite shirts](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/469185045/), I have keep my weight down.
