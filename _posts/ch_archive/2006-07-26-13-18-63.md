I've just activated [Akismet](http://akismet.com/), which is supposed to help prevent comment spam.  If you enter a comment that doesn't show up for a few days (I moderate all comments until you've had one approved, so it won't show up right away), email me and let me know.  If your comment actually is spam, then please go play in traffic on the highway.
