[Next Transformers Trailer Online at Dethroner](http://dethroner.com/index.php/2006/12/20/next-transformers-trailer-online/)

> Itâ€™s dark, but a Transformers movie should (or at least could) be; the franchise is no stranger to dark moments.

I can't decide whether I really like reading Dethroner or not, but this made me laugh.  I mean, yes, I almost cried when [Optimus Prime died](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092106/).  But, to be fair, I was 8.  Does that justify "the franchise is no stranger to dark moments"?  Well, I'll let you be the judge of that.

I can't decide, either, whether I want to see this movie.  I did not see the Dukes of Hazzard movie after loving the series as a kid.  After seeing the cast, I'm pretty sure I made the right call.  But I maybe do want to see Transformers.
