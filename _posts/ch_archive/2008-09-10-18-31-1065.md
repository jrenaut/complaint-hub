I went running today for the first time since before my surgery. Things were going great for the first mile and a quarter. My toe didn't really hurt, and I was feeling pretty good. Then I got a leg cramp. I've never had one before from running. I talked to my sister, and she thinks it's because "the surgery changed the biomechanics of [my] running". That sounds feasible. I was trying to run normally on the bad foot, but I'm sure I wasn't. But it was a good start. I ended up, according to [Map My Run](http://www.mapmyrun.com), running about 1.4 miles then walking 1.6. Next time I expect to do better. I don't have much time to get ready for my 10K.
