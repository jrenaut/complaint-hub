I upgraded to WordPress 2.1, and it broke the tag cloud that I've been using for my categories. I'm going to have to go find the WordPress API again and figure out why it's broken and how I need to fix it, but it's kind of late, and I'm kind of annoyed because I always upgrade and things break and I always think nothing will go wrong and something always does.

WordPress 2.1 doesn't seem like a big upgrade, but maybe there's some stuff I haven't seen yet. I had the impression that it was awesome, but that's not my experience so far.

Edit:  Apparently the plugin that I used for the cloud was just something that some dude wrote, and he hasn't upgraded it for 2.1.Â  I guess I need to brush up on my PHP skills.
