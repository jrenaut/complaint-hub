without going into specifics... i feel the need to vent about a particular individual who tried to ruin the night at the improv.&nbsp_place_holder; my advice to anyone out there who's attending any stand up routine or other live performance, please resist the desire to talk through the entire show.&nbsp_place_holder; i think i speak for the majority when i say, we're not interested in your running commentary or even less interested in whether you think something the comedian said is "so true!" or "so funny!".&nbsp_place_holder; we'll all figure out that you think it's funny when we hear you laughing. &nbsp_place_holder;
