It's only been two months since Trent Reznor released his last album, and now he's got [another one](http://dl.nin.com/theslip/signup). This one, _The Slip_ is a totally free download. I was listening to it for the first time this morning, and I was wondering if there was a mainstream single on it. He's releasing one track as a single so far, _Discipline_, and I have no idea if it will be a hit. I like it, but I like just about every Nine Inch Nails song ever, so I'm hardly a good judge of what others might like. I was talking to a friend and fellow NIN fan about the lack of a single, and he said, "That's what Trent said about _The Downward Spiral_, and then 'I want to **** you like an animal' became our high school anthem'". So I guess we'll just wait and see.
