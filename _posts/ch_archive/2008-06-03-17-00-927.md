So it looks like I'm going to Boston this weekend. The wife has orchestrated a huge family-and-friends get-together at Game 2 of the NBA Finals on Sunday. All the details aren't yet in, but it looks like my father-in-law and at least two brothers-in-law will be there, plus some other friends. We're taking the train up on Sunday, in part because we have a wedding in Annapolis on Saturday. Then back home on the train on Monday to go back to work Tuesday, since we're missing the following Monday for our Vegas trip. I thought Paris was our [babymoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babymoon), but I guess I was wrong. Games at the Garden when the wife was living in Connecticut have achieved legendary status, so I'm looking forward to this. I've never been to a pro sports playoff game. I guess Celtics-Lakers is a good way to start. Of course, we're busy at work right now. So I'm going to be working on the train, which should be interesting. But at least I have that option.
