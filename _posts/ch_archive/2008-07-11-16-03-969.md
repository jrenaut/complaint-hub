[ShysterBall: Are the Nats Deadbeats?](http://shysterball.blogspot.com/2008/07/are-nats-deadbeats.html)  


> Here's my special argument: it doesn't matter if the stadium is unfinished. Given how bad the Nats are, they aren't using half the seats, most of the light bulbs on the scoreboard, and the visitor's bullpen has been virtually untouched, so what's the problem if the place isn't done yet? 

Indeed, one assumes that the city of DC, when it made the deal to help the Nats build a stadium, thought they were getting a real Major League team to fill it.
