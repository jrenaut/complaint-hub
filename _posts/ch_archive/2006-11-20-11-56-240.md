I always thought I was weird because, no matter what, I want lunch at 11:30.  People always yell at me at work because I want lunch early (partly that may be because I get in at 7-730, and many of them get in after 10).  But I found out yesterday that my sister is exactly the same way.  Even if I eat breakfast at 8, a snack at 9, and another snack at 10, I'm still hungry.  And it's not that I eat bad snacks, because my sister is the same way, and she's a health nut.  So while I may sometimes eat bad snacks, that is not the root of my problem. It's comforting to know that it's not me being weird, it's something genetic.  I don't get hungry like that in the afternoon and evening.  It's just the morning.  I wonder if that's related to the fact that I'm more of a morning person, and generally more productive in the morning.  It probably is.
