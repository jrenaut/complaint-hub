[Adobe cripples Flash video with DRM - Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/22/adobe-cripples-flash.html)

> Amazingly, Adobe seems to have entirely missed the fact that the reason that the Flash video format has taken off is that it's so fluid, versatile and remixable -- not because they sucked up to some Hollysaurs and crippled their technology.

I know there are good uses for Flash ([Homestarrunner](http://www.homestarrunner.com), [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com), [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com)).  But for every good usage, there are probably 100 [bad](http://www.napoleondc.com/) [uses](http://www.google.com/search?q=bad+flash+websites).  If you've ever been to a site that takes forever to load, and then when it does, it's impossible to navigate, it was probably made with Flash.  It's not that the technology itself is necessarily bad, it's just that the potential for abuse is so great.

Now, with the introduction of DRM and the inevitable flood of [DMCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCA) takedown notices, perhaps we will see the end of Flash.  Not that I think the absence of Flash will prevent bad websites, but maybe it will help.
