Recently, I got an email from someone I'd never heard of from [Wikimetro.org](http://www.wikimetro.org) wanting to talk about advertising on my site here.

It sounded a bit scammy to me, especially because by addressing me as "Drupalcon", they clearly didn't actually look at the site, but just scraped it with some script. A bit of Googling made it sound like Wikimetro was a scam, but nothing really concrete. So I looked at the local blogs they had listed as participants and emailed one I recognized to ask if [Off Seventh](http://www.offseventh.org/) was actually participating, or just being used to bait others. I got an email back, and it turns out Off Seventh was totally unaware of the deal Wikimetro claimed to have. So, the conclusion I draw from this is that Wikimetro is a scam. If they contact you, I suggest being very cautious. Edit to add: Follow-up from Wikimetro is [here](/blog/wikimetro-says-were-totally-not-a-scam).
