Thankfully I didn't actually watch this, because there would be a giant hole in my TV right now. The Orioles started the eighth inning down 3-2 to the Athletics. No big deal, right? The O's hit like crazy. One run is nothing. According to ESPN's play-by-play, it went a little downhill from there. We start the inning with a walk, then a hit batter. That won't do, so Brian Burres comes on in relief. Stolen base, walk, walk, and it's 4-2. Burress is gone. Some guy I've never heard of comes in to pitch. Walk, walk, strikeout, walk, and it's 7-2. The next pitcher gets a fly out and they're almost out of the inning . . . Except for the grand slam. That is eight runs, ONE HIT, and no errors. Six walks and a hit batter. This is actually worse than the Redskins' performance last night. This is, in fact, worse than any performance in the history of sport. And this on the same day that ESPN announces our worthless manager will be back next year. Does anyone know the record for walks allowed in a year? Are we going to break it this year? If not, I'm _sure_ we'll get it next year. That's something to shoot for. If you'll excuse me now, I think I'm going to go curl up in the corner and cry until I'm an Angels fan.
