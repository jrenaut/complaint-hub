The main site, [complainthub.com](http://www.complainthub.com), and the site to submit your complaints, [submissions.complainthub.com](http://submissions.complainthub.com), have been down since this weekend.  Sorry about that.  My hosting company upgraded from Rails 1.1.6 to 1.2.3 and forgot to tell me.  Thanks to [Mo](http://www.stumblingdonkey.com) for pointing it out.  No thanks to [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com) for not telling me.  Actually, they're a pretty decent hosting company.  If anyone is looking for hosting, let me know, if I refer you I get money.

And the submission site is still down.  I don't know why.  I'll try and get that fixed ASAP.  And by ASAP, I mean when I get around to it.
