[Vinotrip | The Search For A Wine Rating System That Makes Sense](http://www.vinotrip.com/2008/06/20/the-search-for-a-wine-rating-system-that-makes-sense/)

> No longer must two wines be tied at 90, leaving intrepid point chasers scratching their heads while they decide which wine will impress their friends more. The tie can be broken, with one wine receiving a 904.5 and the other falling short at 901.9. Finally, the question can be answered: which wine is better?

I like my wine to be scored. That way, I can make an entirely mathematical decision on my purchase. 

  1. Calculate the Points Per Dollar value (PPD): If the score is 92 and the wine costs $12.99, the DPP is 7.08.
  2. Subtract the California Penalty: My first introduction to California wines was Beringer and the like, and I've never quite forgiven the state, even though it does produce some great wines
  3. Add the Australia Bonus and the lesser New Zealand bonus : We went to Australia and New Zealand on our honeymoon and took a wine tour in Australia's Barossa Valley, so I'm always partial to their wine. As an aside, "Zealand" is not in Firefox's default dictionary. Weird.
  4. Add the label adjustment: The label should be interesting, but not too cutesy. If you have a cool label, you get a bonus. If you made a label you want me to think is cool, or if you phoned it in, you get demerits.
  5. Multiply by [Planck's Constant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_constant).
  6. Realize the wife, who can't drink the wine until the baby is born, is getting antsy.
  7. Buy the bottle of Rosemount Shiraz on sale for $8.99.
Actually, I should probably just keep heading over to [Vinotrip](http://www.vinotrip.com) for scores.
