[The Truth About Cars | Lexus SC430](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/?p=3161)

> The seating position is a throwback to bygone era, when rakish drivers knew low meant go; a time before owners of $100k SUV's looked down on diminutive coupes. Shame the roof is too low for you to look back up at them.

TTAC is often pretty harsh in their reviews, and this one is no different.  The above quote made me laugh.  I'm not sure exactly why, but I thought I'd share it anyway.  They don't much like the SC430, and I guess that doesn't surprise me.  It's always struck me as a car for rich women who want the devil-may-care attitude of a convertible without actually having to be inconvenienced in any way.  I shouldn't bad-mouth them too much, though, because I think my realtor drives one.  And she's very nice, and an excellent realtor.
