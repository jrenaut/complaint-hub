New update to the [Angry Letters](http://www.complainthub.com/?page_id=182) section.  I got a response from Senator George Allen telling me it's not his f'ing problem.  He said it more politely than that.  And he actually has a point - stupid traffic patterns are not really a federal matter.  So I wrote to Delegate James "Jim" Scott and Senator Richard "Dick" Saslaw, my state representatives.  I eagerly await their responses.
