Looking at my Google Analytics stats, many people have come here looking for information about Vector Security. I really have only one complaint about them, and that is that it took two months and repeated requests from my wife to get them to send us the referral bonus check we earned when our upstairs neighbors had their system installed.

But the check arrived yesterday, so it was just an annoyance, not a serious problem. The alarm system has been perfect so far.

If anyone is interested in Vector, and wants to have a system installed, send me an email: Jon at complainthub dot com. I'll be happy to refer you and wait another month or two for a check.
