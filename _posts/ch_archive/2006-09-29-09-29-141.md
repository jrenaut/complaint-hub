Great rant against our current government from John Scalzi.  What I find truly amazing is that, out of two dozen or so comments so far, not a single person has disagreed with him.  I imagine the trolls will come out soon, and I'm sure many of his commenters are regulars who like him in part because of his mostly liberal outlook, but I don't think I've ever seen a political statement online written with such anger that didn't have a bunch of equally angry comments in opposition.
