[Download Day 2008](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/) is coming. We're just not sure when. They're trying to set a world record for software downloads in a day. Since you should be using Firefox 3 as soon as it comes out, this is a great opportunity. In case you haven't tried Firefox, it is light years ahead of Internet Explorer. Even IE7, which Microsoft put out to implement a bunch of functionality that's been in Firefox and other browsers for quite some time, is a steaming pile of crap compared to Firefox. Anyway, join in. It'll be fun to watch the Mozilla Foundation's servers melt with the download traffic.
