I've got a lot going on these days. Work, the kid, family, finding time to spend with the wife - probably a lot like your life. But over the last few months I've added one more thing, and it's getting close to becoming a reality. You may know that I was blogging over [here](http://www.ebooksyearntobefree.com) for a while. It [started out as an experiment](/blog/a-new-project) to see where it would go, or to see if I liked blogging with a more professional tone. But the more I wrote about the ebook industry, the more I hated it. It started to feel like everyone was getting it wrong. $10 ebooks? Really? So I decided I had to do something about it, and the idea for [Manfred Macx publishing](http://www.manfredmacx.com) was born. I'm hoping to launch the site in November. In brief, it will be a place where authors can come and get some help in getting their work out there, and giving fans an opportunity to support them. I will still complain here about DC parking enforcement (Have you _seen_ the VW at 14th and Harvard that's been parked there for 3 weeks? Why haven't they towed it?) and various other things that need complaining about. It's just going to be a bit lower on my priority list. But do check out [Manfred Macx](http://www.manfredmacx.com). At the very least, it will partially excuse my neglect of this blog.
