So I've spent most of my morning reading everything I can find about the Kindle.  I mean, I've spent most of my morning working dilligently.  Yeah.

So, Amazon is going to charge for the books, charge for newspaper subscriptions, and charge for full-text blog feeds.  But they aren't charging any extra for the network connection.

This is pretty cool.  There are some drawbacks.  It's not as sexy as an iPhone, but that's really not that big a deal for me.  It doesn't seem to support PDF, which people had been saying it would, but it supports some ebook formats, plus Microsoft Word and HTML.  Some of the details are fuzzy.  I'm hearing that you can't transfer your own content through the USB port, but not from anyone reliable.  I suppose you could always do it via SD card.

I think I'm going to have to buy one.
