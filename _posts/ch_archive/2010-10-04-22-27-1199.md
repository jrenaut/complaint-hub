At exactly 7:56AM Friday (9/24) morning, Matilda Sheehy Renaut was born at [the DC Developing Families Center](http://www.developingfamilies.org/) in Northeast.

I know I haven't done much posting to this blog recently. Or, really, any. But I've been busy with [other projects](http://www.manfredmacx.com), and the now two kids, and all of that. I'd like to get back to blogging at some point, so I'm keeping this alive, but I make no promises.

Anyway, Matilda. Another great experience at the birth center. The wife's labor was incredibly quick - first contraction was only about five hours before the baby was born.

I'm still getting used to the fact that I have two little girls. Matilda looks JUST like Adelina did at this age except for her chin. Adelina's was a little more like mine. We're curious if they'll end up looking the same as they get older. My little brother and I could have been twins up to age one or so, and now look very different.

It's very convenient to have another girl at the same time of year - she'll be the same size as her sister in the same year/season, so we should be set for hand-me-down clothes.

I'm taking more time off work this time. I took all of last week and all of this week. I'll go back after the Columbus Day holiday next Monday. It's been cool to spend time with the family, and now we should be a little more settled in to the change before I have to go back to work and leave the wife alone at home.

And, in case you're wondering, it's [still crazy, being a dad](/blog/welcome-world-adelina). And both of my girls are amazing.
