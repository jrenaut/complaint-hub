How many times have you heard a radio commercial that directs people to a website?  And how many of those times has the actual site been something different than what you heard?  English is a funny language - we have these things called [homophones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophone), and they can make it difficult.  Sometimes you can figure it out from the context (Assuming you know how to spell), but I've heard commercials, although of course I can't think of an example, where it's impossible.

Part of this is due to the fact that sometimes the company name isn't a real word.  If you've invented the spelling of the company name, I'm not necessarily going to be able to spell it if you say it.

I suppose it's not that big a deal.  It's just dumb.
