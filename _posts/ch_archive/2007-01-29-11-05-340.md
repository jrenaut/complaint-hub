Should we be eating animal products? I mean, you can't tell me that it's nice to the animals to kill and eat them. I think it's a natural part of life - human beings evolved as omnivores. But it's not a necessary part. I like the attitude here that the focus shouldn't be on meat substitutes. Some of the best vegetarian stuff my wife cooks doesn't have any meat substitutes.

I don't know that I could give up meat, though. I've pretty much given up red meat and poultry at home (I was never that crazy about chicken anyway), sticking to vegetables and seafood. But could I give up the occasional bacon cheeseburger at a restaurant? Could I give up sushi? I don't think I could.

But tasty vegan cupcakes? I'm happy to eat those.
