Well, I can't figure out the stupid redirect. I'm trying to redirect the old links (http://www.blog.complainthub.com/?p=XXX where XXX is a number) to the new links (http://www.complainthub.com/?q=?p=XXX). I think there are too many .htaccess redirects going on, and I don't really understand it all. Otherwise, things are good. The friend who said the old layout "made his eyes bleed" has already expressed his approval. Since he picked the colors, he'd better approve. Next on the list is a different project, but then I'll get back to reimplementing "Your Complaints" so you can complain about stuff, too.
