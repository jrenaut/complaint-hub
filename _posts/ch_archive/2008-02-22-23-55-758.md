I will definitely fix the way that Drupal is cutting off the post and making you click "Read More". I hate that when I'm reading someone's blog, and I won't tolerate it here. I just don't know how to fix it. But I will. Edit: Fixed. Whew. Thought I was going to have to go back to WordPress for a minute.
