[Bud Selig is a dirty, dirty liar.](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3912702)

> "I don't want to hear the commissioner turned a blind eye to this or he didn't care about it," Selig told Newsday in a Monday phone interview. "That annoys the you-know-what out of me. You bet I'm sensitive to the criticism. "The reason I'm so frustrated is, if you look at our whole body of work, I think we've come farther than anyone ever dreamed possible," he said, adding, "I honestly don't know how anyone could have done more than we've already done."

"It's like this morning," he continued. "I pushed this old lady down some stairs. I suppose you're going to blame me for that, too? How was I supposed to know about gravity?" It's too bad that every statistic for every player between about 1990 and whenever they manage to institute a _real_ drug policy will always have a cloud over it.
