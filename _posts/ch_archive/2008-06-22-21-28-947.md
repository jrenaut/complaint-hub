One of the nice things about having a pregnant wife is that, when a recipe calls for white wine, she can't help you finish the bottle. Just kidding. We have a bottle of white wine, a 2006 [Primaterra](http://www.primaterrawine.com) pinot grigio. So, now we can calculate the [Complaint Hub Wine Score](/node/938). 

  1. [Alcohol Review](http://www.alcoholreviews.com/labels/Pinot%20Grigio.html) gives it 3.25 stars. We'll convert that to a 100 point scale, multiplying by 20 to get 65. They say it costs $7, and it was on sale at Whole Foods, so we'll give it a PPD of 9.29. That's a pretty decent score.
  2. It's Italian, so no California Penalty.
  3. Again, no Australia or New Zealand Bonus.
  4. It's got a pretty solid label. It's a cheap wine, so I don't expect much, and the label is different, but it's not doofy. Plus 10.
  5. Multiply by Planck's Constant.
  6. Planck's Constant is really small. No one wants a wine score in scientific notation. So let's open up [Open Office Spreadsheet](http://www.openoffice.org) and do some formula magic. First, let's take the arc cotangent, which gives us 1.57. You can quibble about significant digits in the comments.
  7. That's still not a good number. So we divide one by the natural log of that, which gives us 2.21.
  8. I'm not a huge fan of white wine, so let's multiply by 50 and subtract a 25 point White Wine Penalty.
Then we round down, because the digits after the decimal were never really significant anyway. And we're left with 63. So you see, this is clearly a good wine rating system, since it's right in line with the score from another website! The wine tastes fine. Not too sweet, not too dry. It pairs well with a seitan picatta from [Veggie Times](http://www.vegetariantimes.com). It probably has some flavor notes of something. Maybe fruit? White's usually have fruit notes, right? In conclusion, it's a nice value at $7.
