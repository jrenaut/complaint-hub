As usual, the DC Metro area has officially flipped out because we got a little snow yesterday.  I'm the only one at work.  There are usually at least two people here by 6AM.  It's a good thing I remembered my password to turn off the alarm.  Last time I had to open, I set it off and had to call [Honeywell](http://www.honeywell.com/) to reassure them that nothing horrible was happening.

It's funny - I've heard two phones ring this morning, both belonging to people who are NEVER here this early.  One was my boss' phone, and someone might be telling him that the scary wet roads are keeping them at home.  The roads were much worse last night.  The last mile before our place was a sheet of ice at about 4:30PM.  But this morning, the roads were just wet and a little slushy.  I had no trouble getting to work.
