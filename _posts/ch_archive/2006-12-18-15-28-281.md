No, literally a ton of stuff.  I spent much of yesterday helping my siblings and my mom clean out my dad's attic.  Now, the attic still looks terrible.  Much improved, but still terrible.  I just got a call from my brother telling me that, after they dropped two bunk beds, a couch, and various other assorted things at the Salvation Army, they still managed to throw away 2320 pounds of trash.  That's over a ton.  Or, 1052 kg.  That's a lot of stuff.
