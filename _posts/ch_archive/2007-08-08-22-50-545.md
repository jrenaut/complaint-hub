Or is it hot outside? It's not so bad now, but when I got home from work, there was a hot breeze blowing that made me want to move to San Fransisco.

It's good to be back home, though. Vacation was nice, but the cat missed me.

And, if I ever get a reasonable internet connection at work, I'll try to get back in the habit of posting regularly.Â  I know I've been a bad, bad blogger lately.
