[Prehistoric lovers found locked in eternal embrace - CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/02/07/prehistoric.love.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories)

Really?  It will be hard to figure out who they were?  Maybe because they were buried 5000 years ago.  I mean, it's not like there's some old guy you can just go ask.

Seriously, this sounds like an elaborate pre-Valentine's Day hoax.  Right near the place where "Romeo and Juliet" was set, a week before Valentine's Day, we find the remains of two young lovers?  Someone better check and make sure the skeleton doesn't say "Hallmark" on it.
