[Treehugger: Convert Your Car To Run On Ethanol With New Kit](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/07/kit_can_adapt_y.php)

I love the idea of this.  $500-700 and, with a flip of a switch, I can choose to fill my car with gasonline or ethanol.  I'm not sure I'd risk this on my car (It's not even a year old) without doing some research, but it's a great step forward.  Why be forced to buy a poor quality GM product just to use ethanol?  Now, I'm still waiting for the _Back to the Future_ banana peel and stale beer fuel, but I guess I can wait a few more years.  Now all we need is an alternative to ethanol that's a little more sustainable than growing corn.
