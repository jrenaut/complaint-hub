So I'm back at work after my birthday trip to Paris. There are [a ton of pictures here](http://flickr.com/photos/thetejon/sets/72157604765712369/). I haven't finished uploading them as of right now, but there are about 200 posted, so that should keep you busy. And speaking of busy, I've been very busy lately, which is why I haven't been posting anything. I know it's the fifth law of the internet or something that anyone who runs a blog non-professionally must periodically go through a slow phase and not post, then apologize and say they were busy. The good blogs don't do this very often. Anyway, hopefully things are slowing down a little and I can get back to complaining about things. There are certainly things to complain about.
