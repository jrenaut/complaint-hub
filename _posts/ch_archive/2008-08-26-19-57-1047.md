The wife having dinner with a coworker down on U Street is a perfect reason to venture over to everyone's favorite greasy bag of french fries, [Five Guys](http://www.fiveguys.com/). I'm not sure how Columbia Heights survived without them. Of course, Five Guys isn't really helping my waistline. And the months of relative inactivity since I stopped running due to the bunion help even less. But soon that will be no more! I wore shoes yesterday, and today my flip-flops were nearly comfortable. I'll give shoes another try tomorrow as I actually have to go into the office. And that means I can get back to running soon. I have a 10K in six weeks that I'm woefully unprepared for, so that should help a lot. It would certainly be embarrassing if it turned out that I've gained more weight than the wife in the last nine months.
