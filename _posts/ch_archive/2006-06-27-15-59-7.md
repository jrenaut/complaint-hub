I just ordered some hanging plant pots from some strange store I found on Google. I need a new one because I have a hanging plant that has outgrown its pot. None of this is very interesting. However, I just got the shipping confirmation email (Edit:  It was UPS that sent this email, not Novosel.), and it includes this at the bottom: 

> Click here to track if UPS has received your shipment or visit http://www.ups.com/WebTracking/track?loc=en_US on the Internet.

Now, I don't know about you, but "on the Internet" is the LAST place I'd look for www.ups.com. The absolute last place.

Edit: These guys are the fastest online seller I've ever seen. I placed an order at 9:40AM yesterday. The UPS woman showed up at 10:50AM today. For $4.83 in shipping. If you ever need garden supplies, check out [Novosel Enterprises](http://www.novoselenterprises.com/).
