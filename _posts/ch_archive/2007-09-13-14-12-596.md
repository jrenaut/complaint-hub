I just got off the phone with Pepco customer service.  They told me they don't guarantee they'll actually arrive in the four hour window.  They have lots of meters to read, and sometimes they don't arrive on time.  I finally hung up on the CSR I was talking to because I was so furious.  I have no idea what I can do.  I can't take my business elsewhere.

Anyone have any suggestions?
