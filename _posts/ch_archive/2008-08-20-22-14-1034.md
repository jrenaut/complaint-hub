For whatever reason, [NIN.com](http://www.nin.com/index.html#2164622018305888925) has a really crazy archive system, so this link may not work for you, but apparently someone has released an old NIN album on vinyl without Trent's knowledge or approval. 

> You may have heard there's a new re-release of The Downward Spiral on vinyl. I heard that, too. I have no idea what it is or what's on it because the band has had no involvement in it.

How typical of the music industry - a band finds new ways to make money without treating fans like criminals, and some label that has rights to older music decides that it's going to support the artists by cutting them out of the loop. Way to go, record label! That'll show everyone that you're still relevant!
