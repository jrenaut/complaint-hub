[TIME.com Daily Rx: Choose Your Fish Wisely](http://time.blogs.com/daily_rx/2006/10/choose_your_fis.html)

> While Americans are eating more fish on average today than at the turn of the century, weâ€™re not eating the healthiest kinds of seafood. The most popular form of seafood, shrimp, is high in cholesterol and contains low levels of omega-3 fatty acids. And that cafeteria staple, fish sticks, contain very low levels of methylmercury but are equally poor sources of omega-3 oils

You, undoubtedly, should eat more fish.  What I recommend you do is go to the store and purchase some fresh tilapia, a lemon, some broccoli, a few tomatos, garlic, vegetable broth, olive oil, black pepper, and oregano.  Come home and put the fish in some tin foil, drench it in lemon juice, sprinkle with oregano and black pepper, and then seal the tin foil.  Preheat the oven to 400 and bake for 10-15 minutes, maybe more, depending on the thickness of the fish.  If you don't know how to tell if fish is done, consult someone who does.

Meanwhile, saute the garlic in the olive oil.  If you don't already have olive oil, you really should.  I know, it's expensive.  But a bottle lasts a long time, and it's good for you.  Anyway, saute the garlic, then add the tomatos.  Make sure you throw the juice and squishy stuff from the tomatos in to the pan, too.  There should be a layer of liquid covering the pan.  If not, add a bit of vegetable broth.  Once the tomatos are simmering, toss the broccoli, turn down the heat, and cover.  Do NOT stir in the broccoli - it should be sitting on top of the tomatos.  You're basically steaming the broccoli with the tomato juice. If you've timed it correctly, your fish will be done right as the brocolli gets nice and tender.  If you have, let me know, because I've never managed to do it.  When it's all done, throw the fish on a plate, add some of the broccoli/tomato mixture (I think it should go on top of the fish, but that's just me), and enjoy.

I think the problem with fish (It was my problem, at least) is that people are scared to cook it.  It's really easy to cook.  Yes, you should be careful and make sure you've cooked it all the way through.  But other than that, it's very easy to cook, and I find it delicious.  And it's good for you.
