[![All my friends are dead.  :-(](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/195/469171620_64415c181c_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/469171620/) Birthday present from my mom. If you can't read it, it says, "All my friends are dead". It's funny because it's a dinosaur. I found it on [TCritic](http://tcritic.com/archives/all-my-friends-are-dead-t-shirt-by-big-stone-head/). Even more awesome is the kitten explosion t-shirt. I'm not sure it gets any awesomer than a mushroom cloud of kittens. I'm not sure which site I saw kitten explosion on, but if it wasn't TCritic, it was [Hide Your Arms](http://www.hideyourarms.com). It could have been [Preshrunk](http://preshrunk.info), except he stopped posting again.

I wish I could still wear t-shirts to work, but they frown on that at the new job.
