I just got a letter from the Virginia Department of Transportation.  It seems that Senator Saslaw and Congressman Moran passed [my letter](http://www.complainthub.com/angryletters/sevencorners.html) along, and now I'm going to be notified by a member of the Traffic Engineering Section concerning the results of their effort to provide "innovative guide signage and pavement markings".

And people said I was crazy to write to my representatives.  But you see here that it makes things happen.  I mean, who among you has received a letter from VDOT?  I'm holding one in my hand right now.  Maybe I'll frame it, and put it above the mantle next to the flag football trophy.
