[![POPE!](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3220/2419331091_cb84988a13_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/2419331091/)A friend pointed out that I not only got a picture of the Pope, but the gentleman (And I use that term loosely) accompanying him is none other than our fearless leader, President Bush. Laura Bush is just a few steps behind. You can see the large size [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/2419331091/sizes/o/). So that's pretty cool.
