[How to Stop Complaining](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2007/08/how-to-stop-complaining/) via [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com)

> It’s been said that the mind is like a hyperactive monkey. The more you fight with the monkey, the more hyper it becomes. So instead just relax and observe the monkey until it wears itself out.

It's so cute that this guy thinks he can stop people from complaining by wrestling monkeys.  I just want to pat him on his head and say, "There, there".

I 'm mostly kidding.  But the article might as well be about how to reverse rotation of the Earth.  I could no sooner stop complaining than stop breathing.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I will stop doing both of those things at exactly the same time, although I'm not certain which will be the cause of the other.

Still, perhaps his article will be of some use to those of you who don't entirely embrace the art of incessant complaining.
