I was thinking this afternoon that I might watch the Orioles game, since I'm still more or less stuck on the couch. The foot is better, but it's tough to move around. Dinner intervened (The wife has been fantastic about taking care of me while I'm immobile), and we didn't see the beginning of the game. I checked ESPN to find the Orioles down, 6-2, after only one inning. That wasn't encouraging. [Daniel Cabrera](http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/cabreda01.shtml) was walking batters and giving up bombs. It took a minute to find the game - at first I thought MASN was only showing the Nats game (Seriously, who's watching that?), but then we found the Orioles. It was 7-2 by that time. And then the O's came back. Let me take a quick break from writing - as I was typing that last sentence, [Luke Scott](http://www.baseball-reference.com/s/scottlu01.shtml) hit a monstrous home run to win it in the bottom of the 10th after a bad call at the plate to end the Detroit half of the inning. Anyway, a big back and forth game, a huge home run from [Ramon Hernandez](http://www.baseball-reference.com/h/hernara02.shtml) to blow a save for [Joel Zumaya](http://www.baseball-reference.com/z/zumayjo01.shtml), 17 hits for the Orioles. Crazy. But this post is tagged [complaint](/taxonomy/term/119). It was one thing when the Red Sox and Yankees were in Baltimore and the crowd was cheering the visiting team. Not that I think that's okay, but it's expected. But in the top of the tenth, the Tigers cheers were _loud_. The Tigers! That's the team from Detroit. Who cares about the Tigers? Okay, so the wife likes the Tigers. She's from Michigan, so it's okay. But I don't expect to hear Tigers chants at Camden Yards. Peter Angelos needs to go. Camden Yards is going to be the fastest stadium to 50,000,000 fans in the history of baseball (Although I have to think that the new Yankees stadium will eventually beat that). But if you look at the [average attendance](http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teams/baltatte.shtml) each year, you see a big dropoff. It was 45,000 a year for the first seven years, then it dropped under 40,000, and then under 30,000. The Orioles have not shown a commitment to winning in a decade. Their payroll isn't the problem - they don't spend Red Sox/Yankees money, but they aren't the Marlins, either. But Angelos has been too busy complaining about the Nationals to bother putting a good team on the field. This year has been a surprise - the offseason looked like they were rebuilding, and then all of a sudden we have the best team we've had in Baltimore in a while. Anyway, it was a fun game to watch. I hope Angelos was busy doing something else and didn't get to enjoy it, too.
