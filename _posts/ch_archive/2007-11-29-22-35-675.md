At 7:21PM Eastern, I saved my 2007 [Nano](http://www.nanowrimo.org) novel for the last time.  50,262 words, according to the word counting robots at the website.  I'm happier with it than I was before, but the plot is still kind of strange, and I think my characters are motivated more by wanting to advance the story than by any sort of realistically human motivations.  But that's okay.

Now I can go back to my normal routine.  There are a bunch of things I thought of doing in November that I've had to put off.  Now I can not think of them again until next November, when I'll remember that I said I would do them in December or January.

Anyway, it feels good to finish again.
