Well, she's gone temporarily.  We got in on Friday (A day late because we missed our flight.  If you're flying from Dublin to Philadelphia on US Airways, do yourself a favor and get there early.), and she flew out yesterday for work.  She'll be back Thursday.

Unfortunately, as usual when she's not here, I didn't sleep well last night.  I haven't figured out why I sleep better when she's here, but I do.  And the stupid cat didn't help.  She was loud and irritating pretty much all night.  I don't think I got more than an hour straight of sleep all night.

Anyway, hopefully tonight I'll sleep better.

The trip, by the way, was fantastic.  I'll write more at some point, but we had a great time.  Dublin is very expensive, however.  But I sure do love Guinness.
