I saw this on [Fark ](http://www.fark.com)this morning. This guy presents a pretty good argument for coming to a compromise on gun control (and rewriting the ambiguous Second Amendment). He compares a gun to a car. Both are capable of killing people if used incorrectly (Or even by accident when used properly), but both become much safer as people learn to use them responsibly.

A big part of his point is that the utter refusal to compromise by the Democrats and Republicans (Beyond "I'll vote for your bill if you vote for mine" because my constituents don't really care about your bill) means that, too often, we're stuck with one extreme or the other, even if most people who understand the issue agree that both extremes are wrong.

Unfortunately, there's no chance anything this sensible would ever happen in Washington. Oh, well.
