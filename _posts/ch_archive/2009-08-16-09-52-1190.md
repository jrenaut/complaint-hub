It was unofficial baby night at [Room 11](http://www.room11dc.com/) last night. We took the kid and met up with some friends who have a son in her daycare class. We went at 5, right when they opened, and sat outside on the porch. By the time we left around 7pm (The kid was well on her way to turning into a pumpkin), there were no less than a half dozen children under 2 on the porch. Most of the patrons, save one couple in the corner, found the children delightful. Our little monkey, for example, was making friends by pushing her chair around the porch after she finished eating. and flirting with the guys at the next table. I like Room 11. I should have written down what I drank. I had a Chilean carmenere that was really good. I had never heard of that grape before I tried the [Montes Cab/Carmenere blend](http://www.monteswines.com/english/nuestros_vinos/ls_cabernetcarmenere.htm) (A fantastic bottle, btw), then my mom bought me a bottle of [Root: 1](http://www.root1wine.com/#carmenere) (Another great bottle). And now it's one of my favorite grapes. I also had a malbec that was good. They sell wine by the glass, starting at $6. Most of the glasses are $8-9. They have a very Belgian beer selection, which is not really my thing, but I think the beers are good for the many of you who do like Belgians. They had two beers on tap, also. I forget what they were, but I remember approving. We ate a meat plate and a cheese plate, both good, and the wife and I split a cheese panini which was pleasant. The service was good. Our waiter was friendly and easy-going and pretty attentive. He made some good suggestions on the meats and cheeses, since I'd never heard of most of it, and couldn't pronounce any of it. The porch had a very "neighborhood" feel to it. A self-selected, limited slice of the neighborhood, but still a neighborhood. The couple we were with brought their dog, and he waited outside the fence until we finished. At least three or four people stopped to pet him as they walked down Lamont Street. It's a pleasantly busy intersection - enough traffic to be interesting to watch, but not enough to disturb the atmosphere. So, go check it out. We'll definitely be back.
