Just over fifteen hours until [Nano](http://www.nanowrimo.org) starts. I'm ready to go. I've got the beginning of the story rattling around in my head. I'm a little afraid that the beginning is ALL I have in my head, and the whole middle and end thing is going to be a struggle. But now is not the time for doubts.

I didn't sleep well last night, and I'm not sure why, but it's going to make it even harder to stay up until midnight tonight and start before I go to bed. I do that most years. It feels like a nice head start.

Anyway, I'm excited about the story.  I have a name for my main character.  Well, I have a first name.  She needs a last name.  I notice that none of you slackers responded to [my request for character names](?p=650).  That's fine.  When I'm a rich and famous novelist, I'll just forget all of you.
