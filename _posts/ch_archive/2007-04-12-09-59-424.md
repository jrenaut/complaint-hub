Perhaps [a strange source](http://www.goats.com/forums/news/3441/) for this news, but I am honestly saddened to hear that Kurt Vonnegut died last night.  He wrote some fantastic books, and some equally (perhaps even more so) fantastic short stories.  I highly recommend that anyone who reads this should go out and find something he wrote and read it.  _Cat's Cradle_ was one of my favorites.

My source for this news, noted above, linked to [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/11/books/11cnd-vonnegut.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin), which is a nice read.
