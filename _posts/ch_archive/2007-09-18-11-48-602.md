I just can't seem to get worked up over the DC voting rights push.  Sure, it bugs me that I don't have a representative.  But when I see the "Taxation without Representation" license plates (which aren't the choice I thought they were - they're standard issue DC tags) and I read about the "injustice" that this is, my immediate reaction is, "Stop whining".

It may be that I moved from Virginia into the District knowing full well that we had no representatives, so I feel a little silly complaining about it now.

I really do want to have someone speaking for me at the national level.  I think it's the right thing to do.  And I'm even okay with this little deal with Utah to placate Republicans who see giving DC a vote as a Democratic ploy to gain a seat.

Maybe there's some argument that would strike a nerve and get me worked up over this that I just haven't heard yet.  Anyone know what that argument might be?
