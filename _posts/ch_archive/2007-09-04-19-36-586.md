Based on advice from my friend, [the cat whisperer](http://hedgeshaman.blogspot.com/), my cat doesn't get any food in her dish between the time I go to work and 6pm.  I started doing this months ago when it was either adjust the cat's behavior or mail her to Abu Dhabi.

It's now just after 5:30, so she's getting food very shortly.  Do you know what she's doing now?

She's licking the crumbs out of the bottom of the bowl.  I've never seen her do that before.  Maybe it's because the construction next door started back up after the long weekend.

In any event, I'm not exactly sure what her problem is, but I guess I should feed her soon.
