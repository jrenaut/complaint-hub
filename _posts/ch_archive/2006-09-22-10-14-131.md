So, I'm at work right now, and I was about to actually do some work, and apparently my server died overnight, which isn't that unusual.  It's just a local server running on my machine so I can test our Java web app.  It dies a lot, it's not a big deal.  Except that this morning, it wouldn't come back up.  So I tried rebuilding it, and got this error: "creation was not successful for an unknown reason".  Now, we use [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/platform) as our [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), and for the most part I love it.  It works well, it has a lot of nice conveniences built in, and an active developer community writing plugins.  But when I get error messages that say, "Like, um, something's wrong, but, um, we don't know what it is, or how you might fix it", then I start to get a little annoyed.

Now, I know it's tough to write good error messages.  Believe me, I've written some bad ones myself.  But, damn it, I'm actually trying to get some stuff done here, and Eclipse is not cooperating.  Stupid Eclipse.  If I hadn't already gone to get coffee, I'd do that now.  That's how mad I am.  Instead, I'll probably waste some time until some coworkers get here, and then waste some more time, and then maybe try to fix my server.  Maybe.
