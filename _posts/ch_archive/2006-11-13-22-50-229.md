Local (to me, at least) beer heaven The Brickskeller now has [Bell's Beer](http://www.bellsbeer.com/) in a bottle. For those not familiar with Bell's, don't even finish reading this post. Get to The Brickskeller and have an Oberon. They have a KEG OF OBERON. Why are you still reading? Go, now! They might run out.

Thanks to guest-blogger Gayle for the head's up.
