So, I'm trying to think of something I want to write about rather than rehash yesterday's Orioles game. No one wants to hear about it - O's fans will just get depressed, and the Rays don't have any fans. Maybe the players' mothers. Anyway. So I thought I might write about [Quacker of the House Nancy Pelosi](ch/340) advising the President to [boycott the Olympic opening ceremonies](http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/261728308/index.html) to protest China's all-around unpleasantness, but then I was reading the article and my eyes started to glaze over. No one cares what advice Nancy Pelosi has for President Bush. She'd be more likely to get a reaction out of a large rock. Then I thought I should say something about [IBM's temporary suspension from getting federal contracts](http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iDeTQGUI5A6rc2LDmbYGMSIme2DQD8VOOSF00) for some horrendous thing they did to EPA that no one will explain. This is huge news, but until we get some more details, it isn't all that interesting. Or maybe it's not interesting because my mind is refusing to grasp the massive incompetence or malice necessary to actually be disciplined by the government at all. But really, the most exciting thing about today is that I plan to go [meet Charles Stross](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2008/03/beer_in_dc.html) at the Brickskeller tonight. He's one of my favorite authors, and he's in town for something or other. He claims he's trying to fend off jet-lag, but anyone going to a place with a beer list like [this](http://lovethebeer.com/beer-list.html) is merely fending off sobriety.
