[AT&T Legal Policy](http://home.bellsouth.net/csbellsouth/s/s.dll?spage=cg/legal/att.htm&leg=tos) Via [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net), [Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com), and others.

So, AT&T has decided that they can terminate your service if your conduct " tends to damage the name or reputation of AT&T, or its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries." I'm not exactly sure what "tends to damage" means, but it sounds ominous.

That being said, I do not use AT&T as a web host or ISP. If you have any grievances against AT&T, or its parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries, feel free to contact me. I will happily provide a soapbox for you to stand on and voice your complaints.

You can do it [here](http://submissions.complainthub.com), or, if you have something particularly poignant, well-written, and not slanderous or libelous, I would probably be willing to allow a guest post to the main site. Email Jon at complaint hub dot com.Â  I will be your voice, because AT&T has no power over me, and I believe in every human being's right to complain.
