I say this every year, but I didn't think I could, in good conscience, let this complaint go by.  There is Christmas stuff everywhere.  I see Christmas commercials on TV.  My beloved Caribou Coffee has their employees decked out in red, and they have their yuletide napkins out.

It's bad enough that the day after Thanksgiving is the official start of the holiday shopping season.  But by the time December 25th rolls around, I want to shoot anyone who mentions the word 'Christmas'.

Do you think our new Senator, Jim Webb, would care?  As I promised, I'm going to write to him as soon as [Nano](http://www.nanowrimo.org) is over.  He's an old school Navy guy.  He probably is opposed to the excessive commercialization of Christmas, right?
