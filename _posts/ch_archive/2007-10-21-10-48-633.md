Overall, I'm really happy with Gutsy.  I find myself [spinning the desktop cube](http://www.compiz-fusion.org/) just because I can.  But I haven't done much yet.  Today I think I'm going to create a separate partition for my /home directory, and I'm going to pull the pictures I took yesterday off my camera and see about uploading them to Flickr.

I have some small issues.  First, the gnash free flash plugin doesn't really work for Firefox on a 64 bit system.  The proprietary flash plugin is fine.

My panel icons are displaying at the center of the panel, not all the way on the right like they're supposed to.  I haven't really searched for a solution to this yet.

Other than that, this is a pretty slick OS.  Wireless has been perfect - the only setup I did was selecting my network and providing my WPA password once.  The frequent disconnects I got on Feisty have not happened at all.

Gutsy supports my Nvidia video card much better than Feisty.  I just had to choose a different driver in a drop down menu and then reset the screen resolution.

Anyway, if you've been thinking about trying out [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com), now is the time.
