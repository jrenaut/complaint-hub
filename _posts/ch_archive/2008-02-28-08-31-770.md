[Nashville copyright craziness -- success! Rematch on Mar 5 - Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/27/nashville-copyright-1.html)

> Yesterday's rally in Nashville to stop a new copyright bill that would put the expense of policing the movie industry's business model onto universities was a success -- the bill has been stalled and won't be reconsidered for ten days. 

I have two friends down in Nashville (Well, just outside of Nashville, but close enough). One of them probably knows about this already. In fact, I was sort of expecting a [post](http://www.midnightcheese.com) on the subject. I won't elaborate on all the reasons why laws like this are absurd - BoingBoing does it pretty regularly, and I don't really have anything to add. But if you're in or around Nashville, especially if you are or soon will be a student at a Tennessee college, this matters to you. Don't let them raise your tuition to support the lazy recording industry that stubbornly refuses to embrace the new business available to them through the internet.
