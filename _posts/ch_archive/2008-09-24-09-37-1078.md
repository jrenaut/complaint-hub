No, not the picture. That's clearly not my daughter. No, the wife was taking her to get her hearing tested and had some issues finding the place she had to go. The kid was fussing, so the wife turned on the radio, thinking she'd tune in a station that doesn't exist, and maybe the white noise would calm the kid down.  
  
Well, the last time I was in the car, I was listening to [Nine Inch Nails](http://www.nin.com), and that came on instead of the radio.  
  
Sure enough, the kid stopped crying right away. I think she might have fallen asleep.
