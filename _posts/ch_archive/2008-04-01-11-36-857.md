When I switched from Wordpress to Drupal for this site, I went to great lengths to try and keep all the old links working. I clearly didn't do as good a job as I would have liked. Every day, people follow internal links that Drupal doesn't recognize. If you click a link here at Complaint Hub (other than the Home link at the top) that takes you to the front page of the site, it's probably a broken link. Feel free to leave a comment on the page that had the link and let me know, and I'll fix it.
