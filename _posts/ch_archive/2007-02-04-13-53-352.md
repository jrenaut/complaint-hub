Today is the big day. When people all over the country gather together in living rooms and sports bars (but [not churches](http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/6436876)) to watch the best commercials advertisers have to offer, and maybe a football game.

If I were a betting man, and I'm not, except at the craps table, I would take the Colts to cover. The spread is 7 last I checked, and I think the Colts will win by that much. I'm 7-3 picking winners so far in the playoffs, which means maybe I should be betting on the games. But those picks have been ignoring the spread.

In any event, I'm hoping that Peyton finally wins a Super Bowl so we can stop talking about how he hasn't won a Super Bowl. And I'm hoping the Bears get pounded, because I've been telling everyone all season that they aren't very good, and they're running out of time to prove me right. Yes, I realize they made the Super Bowl. But who did they beat? No one. The whole NFC sucks.

So, we're going to a Super Bowl party at the home of frequent reader and commenter gayleforcewinds, who <strike>remains the only girl</strike> , along with her sister, are the only girlsÂ <strike></strike>I know who don't live with a guy, yet own a big-screen HDTV. We went to her party last year, too, and I'm looking forward to it. Hopefully it will be a good game, too.
