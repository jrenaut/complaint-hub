The wife and I had dinner at [Rumba Cafe](http://www.rumbacafe.com/) in Adams Morgan last night. It was a 1000 point reservation at [Open Table](http://www.opentable.com), which puts us almost to a $50 gift certificate to any restaurant that deals with Open Table, which is awesome. The Rumba Cafe website seems to be under maintenance this morning (I think it should be euthanized, personally (And did you know that "euthanized" isn't in the default Firefox dictionary? Weird)), but no matter. We sat outside, since it was so nice last night. The service was very good, the beer mediocre, and the food was excellent. I had the steak with a fried egg on top, served with rice and black beans and a fried plantain. Reminded me of [Costa Rican "casados"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Costa_Rica), which I love. The wife had some kind of fish, I forget what, but it was good, too. I highly recommend Adams Morgan when it's not overrun with kids (By kids I mean 23-year-olds). 8PM on a Tuesday it's alive with people (Plenty of kickballers and others just out for dinner or a drink) but doesn't have that "everyone around you is wasted" vibe that it gets on the weekend. It was just a nice spring evening.
