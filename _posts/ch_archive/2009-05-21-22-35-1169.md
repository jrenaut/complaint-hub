I found out today that Parents.com is having [a contest](http://www.parents.com/parents/file.jsp?item=/marketing/contests/PMM_CoverContest09/PMM_09CoverContest_LandingPage&temp=yes&psrc=SS9044FL02) to get your cute kid on the cover of their magazine. No offense to little Trevor, Cover Model 2008, but my little clownfish is a bazillion times cuter. We have no plans this weekend beyond her first baseball game (Orioles at Nationals on Sunday). So I'm planning to take some really cute pictures. What I need from you, readers (All of you who are still paying attention after the lack of updates these recent months), is suggestions on cutening up my daughter. She's already off-the-charts cute, but I need more. I need photos of her that will literally make your eyeballs melt with cuteness. Like a puppy raised to the kitten power. I want to make [Anne Geddes'](http://www.annegeddes.com/) babies look like little gargoyles. How do I do that? Any suggestions are welcome. She's a very smiley baby, so that isn't an issue. What makes a cute baby photo?
