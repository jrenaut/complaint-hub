I'm kind of terrified of this thing.  I love baseball, and this is going to hurt.  It's a necessary hurt, like tearing off the old bandage, but it's still going to suck.  There are already leaks that Roger Clemens is on the naughty list, and the promise of other big names.

I hate Clemens, but he's the best pitcher of my generation, and I don't want to see his name tainted like that.  Maybe it will knock him down a peg and remind him that he's not actually bigger than baseball and teams will stop letting him get away with this "I'll pitch when I'm good and ready and we're playing at home" garbage.

And I'm afraid that other big names are really going to hurt.  I hope the Orioles release everyone on the list.  Immediate, unconditional release for anyone breaking the rules.  I would rather watch the Orioles have the worst season in the modern era, or promote our entire AA team, than watch them employ cheaters.

My great hope for all of this is that maybe now the Steroid Era can end.  No more.  I want it to be over so we can go back to thinking about baseball, not asterisks.
