[Time.com - Time to Close the Book on Washington Pages?](http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1542874,00.html)

Some are calling for an end to the page program after Mark Foley's illegal-no-matter-what-the-FBI-says activities.  This is a truly wonderful idea.  Really great.  They haven't been punished enough already.  We should also take away this wonderful opportunity for young people to learn about politics just because one jackass can't control his sexual urges.  Surely Foley's actions must mean that all pages are being molested by all senators and congressmen, right?
