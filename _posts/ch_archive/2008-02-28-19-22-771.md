[Caramelized Tofu Recipe - 101 Cookbooks](http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/caramelized-tofu-recipe.html)

> Here's how it came together: a quick survey of my kitchen revealed tofu and a cluster of brussels sprouts. There was also a vibrant bouquet of cilantro tucked into the refrigerator door begging to be used. I scanned the cupboards and pulled down a small bag of (already toasted!) pecans and the remnants of a once full bag of my favorite sugar. Garlic? Check.

I know that a lot of people have a very strong reaction to brussels sprouts and tofu. Kind of like my reaction to Hillary Clinton. But the wife LOVES brussels sprouts, and so when I saw this recipe, I tried it out. It's really excellent. If you don't enjoy caramelized tofu with pecans, you're crazy. Or allergic. And not only is it delicious, but it's also made in only one pan (Two if you cook rice with it, which I recommend) so it's pretty easy to clean up. Anyway, you should try it. I didn't bother toasting the pecans this time (I did the first time I made it), and I didn't notice a difference.
