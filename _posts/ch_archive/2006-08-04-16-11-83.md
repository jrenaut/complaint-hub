[Charlie's Diary: Genre neuroses 101](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2006/08/genre_neuroses_101.html)

I don't really care if you read the above-linked post, although it is interesting and amusing.  I found it via [John Scalzi's blog](http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/).  The important part of this post is that Stross is a cool author.  As is Scalzi.  I don't remember how I first came across Stross' novel _Accelerando_, which he had shared online.  I imagine I found it through [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net).  But I read it, and enjoyed it, and kept reading his stuff.  I think _Iron Sunrise_ is my favorite thus far.

I really should read more.  It makes me want to write, which is both good and bad.  It's good because I like writing, but it's bad because I can never seem to keep at it long enough to finish anything, so it's frustrating.   Maybe I'll get a chance to hit the library this weekend.
