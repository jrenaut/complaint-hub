So, I haven't heard all the details.  But it looks like Taylor wasn't doing anything wrong, which is both better and worse.  If he really had turned his life around, it's an even bigger tragedy that he died so young.

Anyway, a ticket to tomorrow's game just fell into my lap, so I'll get to see the tribute and pick up a #21 towel that they're giving out to everyone.

I'm excited to go, although that's mostly because I haven't been to a game in years.  An old college roommate has season tickets, and when we lived together, I used to go to some of the games with him. But we kind of lost touch after I graduated, and I'm not on his invite list anymore.

So, it should be cool.  It's definitely a winnable game against Buffalo, although we haven't played too well against that division this year.  Two overtime wins against the miserable Jets and Dolphins, and that utter embarrassment against the Patriots.

I'm going to Metro there, which I've never done before.  Apparently there's a relatively new Blue Line stop that's less than a mile away.  That should be a disaster after the game, but that's fine.  Getting out of FedEx is always an ordeal.

But it will all be worth it to spend the day yelling and drinking beer.
