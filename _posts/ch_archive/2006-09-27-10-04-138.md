[![This is what happens when your cat swallows a sewing needle](http://static.flickr.com/107/253753159_828af37812.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/253753159/) She swallowed a sewing needle, but the vet removed it, and now she just looks a little ridiculous. Thanks to [Northside Veterinary Clinic](http://www.northsideveterinary.com/) for the diagnosis and [SouthPaws](http://www.southpaws.com/) for the surgery. I'd recommend both if you're in the area and in need of a vet.
