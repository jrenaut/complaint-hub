[xkcd - A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language - By Randall Munroe](http://xkcd.com/c263.html)

> The world is so complicated - the more I learn, the less clear anything gets.

I love xkcd.  Three times a week, this guy makes me laugh.  You know when someone makes a comment about something, and you hear it, and you think, "OMFG, that is EXACTLY the way I feel, but I've never been able to put it into words!"?

Well, I get that feeling reading xkcd at least once a week.  If you are not reading this webcomic regularly, you are not truly an internet geek.  You probably are also not prepared in the event of a velociraptor attack.  Remember, they do not know fear.
