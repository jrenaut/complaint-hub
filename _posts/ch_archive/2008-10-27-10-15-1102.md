I know this may seem slightly ridiculous coming from a guy who runs a blog called Complaint Hub, but doesn't it make you laugh when someone goes to a whole lot of trouble to publicly complain about something they could (and should) just fix themselves?  


> THIS IS A FLOOR SHARED REFRIGERATOR  
Please toss out old food  
IT SMELLS!!!  
  
NEED VOLUNTEERS TO CLEAN REFRIGERATOR AND FREEZER  
SIGN UP SHEET?

  
  
I think it should be a law - if you put out a request for volunteers with a sign-up sheet, your name should be first on the list. The laziness here is really astounding. Well, not really, I'm never really surprised by how lazy people are, but it should be astounding. Not only has the sign-maker not actually done any cleaning, but he or she didn't even put up a sign-up sheet.
