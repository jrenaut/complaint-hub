[Boing Boing: Will Bix kill the record industry? (I hope so)](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/07/17/will_bix_kill_the_re.html)

This is a cool idea.  This new company, Bix, started by the guy who build [epinions](http://www.epinions.com), is going to pretty much move American Idol online, except without obnoxious hosts.  The idea is to hold online contests, where maybe everyone pays an entry fee and the winner gets a chunk, or things like that.

Let's see . . . combine YouTube with American Idol, tempt people with the idea of getting "discovered", and sell advertising everywhere?  That sounds like a business model that could work for a while.

Plus, if it gets big enough, maybe some cool bands will get discovered that don't sound like they were manufactured for MTV.  I think the musings at BoingBoing that suggest this could kill the recording industry are a little far-fetched, but giving up-and-coming musicians and whatnot a lower barrier to entry into the market sounds good to me.
