So, it's 2008. The wife and I are enjoying the day off. Well, I am, at least - she has work to do. I think I'm going to bake some bread (Still trying to get a loaf of whole wheat to turn out as nicely as the white loaf did).  And I'll probably play around on the computer.  Maybe even do something constructive. I don't have any big resolutions. I'm trying to be more organized and motivated, get more done, and that sort of thing.

The tv is on, and there was just a commercial for a toilet cleaner that kills 99.9% of germs deep down into your toilet.  The commercial ends with a mom walking out after cleaning the toilet, patting her young son on the head as he goes to use it.

I have a better idea when it comes to protecting your kids from germs in the toilet - tell them not to stick their hands in it.  I mean, come on.  Cleaning is great, but toilets are dirty.  You know what we put in there, right?

Anyway, I resolve to be less annoyed by stupid things like that.  I'll probably still write about them sometimes, though.
