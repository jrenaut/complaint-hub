I've been re-added to the [DC Blogs](http://dcblogs.com/index.php) [Live Feed](http://dcblogs.com/index.php?page_id=299) and [Blog Directory](http://dcblogs.com/index.php?page_id=590). I suppose that means I have to write something about DC. If you're interested in DC blogs, they have an extensive list, so you should go check them out. Or ask them to add yours, if you have one.
