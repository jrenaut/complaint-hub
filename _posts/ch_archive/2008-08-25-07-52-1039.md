It will be six weeks on Wednesday since I had my [foot surgery](/blog/foot-surgery-awesome), and today I wore two shoes to work. For many of you, that may not seem like a big deal. You probably wear two shoes to work every day. But try only wearing one for a while. Better yet, try only wearing one because your foot is so swollen that it won't fit into the shoe. Then you'll see. So the foot is a little uncomfortable in the shoe, but not terrible. And I brought the boot, just in case. But I'm hoping to make it through the day with my shoe on.
