I just hit the 25,000 word mark in my novel.  It's going well, although I'm currently suffering from a small case of writer's block.  I ended a chapter without an idea for the next one, and I'm a little stuck.  But I should be okay.

In more exciting news, my mom is not only trying [Nano](http://www.nanowrimo.org) this year, but is really enjoying it and looking forward to next year.  She doesn't think she'll hit 50,000 this year, which is fine, but it sounds like she's all set to try again in 2007.

I'm not sure what it is about human beings that drives us to recruit friends and family to join us in the weird and sometimes crazy things we do, but it's pretty universal, so it must have its root in some basic part of humanity.  "Misery loves company" doesn't quite cover it all.  As much as Nano can be frustrating and take up all your time and make you want to scream, I find that the good far outweighs the bad.  So it's not misery (Except when you get stuck).

I encourage you all to try Nano, too.  There was an article about it in the Washington Post this past Saturday, and the number of people trying it goes up every year.  You're running out of time to join up before it hits the tipping point and EVERYONE is doing it.  You don't want to get on the bandwagon late, do you?
