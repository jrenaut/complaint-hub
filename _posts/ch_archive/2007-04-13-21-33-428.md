My [race](http://www.stopcsa.org/race/) starts in about ten and a half hours. I'm honestly a little nervous. I've just had a weird 24 hour cold. I banged my foot on the door yesterday, and now have a cut on the top of my big toe. I'm not quite sure how this whole thing works.

But I can't imagine it's that difficult. I mean, you show up, you get a number and a little sensor on your shoes, you line up, someone says go, and you run. I'm really curious as to what it will be like. I imagine adrenaline kicks in when you're surrounded by all those people. There are 793 participants, but many of them are doing the walk, not the run.

According to the participant list at the website, I'll be number 360. That's a pretty sweet number. So, if you're going to be near West Potomac Park tomorrow morning at 8AM, you can come cheer us on.

Now I think I'm going to bed. Don't want to be tired in the morning.
