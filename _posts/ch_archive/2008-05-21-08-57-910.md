[Orioles thump Yankees, 12-2](http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=280520110) What is going on with Daniel Cabrera? Seven innings, 86 pitches (52 for strikes), no walks, and the only runs he allowed were on a two run home run by the guy who's going to break Bonds' record. His season WHIP is 1.23, down from over 1.5 for his career. It sounds like he's actually listening to me when I say, "Hey, Cabrera, you have a hell of an arm - THROW STRIKES". Apparently there was a little bit of an uproar after LaTroy Hawkins retaliated for Cabrera hitting Jeter in the hand by throwing one behind Luke Scott. As is my usual disclaimer, I didn't see the game. But if Daniel Cabrera hits your guy in the hand, you can pretty much assume it was accidental. Yes, he's been throwing more strikes recently. But he still has a 7 walk game this year. He walked 9 in his first 10 innings pitched. The guy has control issues. I mean, if Greg Maddux hits your guy, then absolutely retaliate. It was totally on purpose. But Cabrera? Give him a break. The best part about this is it keeps the Orioles three games back, keeps the Yankees in last place, and was a rare "good hitting performance and good pitching performance in the same game" for the Orioles.
