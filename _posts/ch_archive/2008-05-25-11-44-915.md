[![DSC_9672](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3166/2520471337_e092011033_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/2520471337/)We went to our first game using my company's season tickets. The seats are great, just past first base. The results of the game weren't too great - a 5-2 loss to the Brewers. Luckily, I'm an Orioles fan, and I don't really care too much if the Nats lose. Not many others seem to care, either - 30,029 was the announced attendance, just shy of 3/4 full. For a beautiful Saturday night over Memorial Day weekend, I expected a full house. There were a ton of kids there - the lines for ice cream were crazy, but it was easy to get a beer. The rest of the pictures are [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/sets/72157605247055343/). They're probably only really interesting to me, but you're welcome to look at them, too.

Always nice to see a future first ballot Hall of Famer in the prime of his career. And we saw [Charlie Manning's](http://www.baseball-reference.com/m/mannich01.shtml) major league debut. He gave up a hit and struck out two, so I imagine he's pleased with that. Finally, we made a return trip to Ben's Chili Bowl, fantastic as usual. For $7, the veggie chili cheese fries are a deal by ballpark standards. Going to the stadium and skipping Ben's is just crazy.
