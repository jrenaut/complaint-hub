My fiancee leaves for Puerto Rico today.  She's going for a quick getaway with a friend, and she'll be back next Wednesday, just in time for me to leave for Vegas on Thursday.  I think it's good that we take separate vacations sometimes.  I mean, my trip to Vegas is my bachelor party, so that's obviously separate.  But we'll continue taking separate vacations after the wedding.  Not all the time, but sometimes.  I mean, we're going to be hanging out with each other a lot, for a long time.  Having a few days here and there apart makes us appreciate the rest of the time even more.
