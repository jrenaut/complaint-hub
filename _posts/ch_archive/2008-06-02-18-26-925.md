Via [Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com), our new local Best Buy in Columbia Heights is part of the [free electronics recycling test](http://bestbuy.tekgroup.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=4567). 

> Starting June 1, 117 stores in the Baltimore, San Francisco, and Minnesota markets are inviting customers to bring in no more than two (2) units per day, per household, for recycling at no charge. Customers can bring items such as televisions and monitors up to 32‚Äù, computers, phones, cameras, and other electronics devices and peripherals in for recycling.

This is really great for DC residents, because while the dump does take electronics to be recycled, my one experience there ended with a never-ending line that I soon abandoned. And now the old and busted computer sitting in the trunk of my car can finally have a new home!
