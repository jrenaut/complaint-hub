[Touch Messenger: Braille Text Messaging - Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/touch-messenger-braille-text-messaging-187768.php)

The first time I really thought about things like this was a few years ago when I had a deaf coworker.  Of course I understand the concept of being deaf, or blind, but it never sinks in until you spend some time with someone who actually is deaf or blind.  But you never think about things like, "How would a blind person text message?"

My deaf coworker called his little two way text messager a "deaf person's cell phone".  I had never thought about how useful something like that would be to someone who's deaf, but once I saw him use it, it's obvious.  But I'm glad to see some of the gadget companies looking around and seeing niches that need to be filled.
