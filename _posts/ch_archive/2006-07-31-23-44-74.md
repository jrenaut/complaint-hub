The Piker Press is an online magazine run by some friends I met doing [Nanowrimo](http://www.nanowrimo.org).  This week, the "Peek of the Week" is a photo I took at the [Getty Museum](http://www.getty.edu/museum/) in L.A..  Check out the rest of the Press, too - plenty of interesting fiction and whatnot.
