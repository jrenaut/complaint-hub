I don't know about you, but [LOLCats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcat) are one of my guilty pleasures. I don't know why I still find them funny, but I do. I can stop any time, really. This one is particularly funny because of [my irrational loathing for Wolf Blitzer](/blog/wolf-blitzer-needs-go). If you replaced Wolf with a cat, it might be the first time in recorded history that replacing _anything_ with a cat resulted in a _decrease_ in smug self-centered-ness.
