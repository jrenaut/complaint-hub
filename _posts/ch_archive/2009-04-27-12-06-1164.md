Internet forums are often wonderful. They can take a group of people who are spread across the globe, joined only by a common interest, and bring them together to talk and make friends. Or they can be terrible. You can have something like the [Columbia Heights Community Forum](http://www.columbiaheightsnews.org/forum/), which takes people with common interests who are already co-located in one DC neighborhood, and drives them apart. [At least someone notices my struggles](http://theheightslife.blogspot.com/2009/04/all-around-neighborhood-pancakes-crime.html) with the forum. It's really an unbelievable amount of hate and rage and incoherent ranting. Some go around pushing buttons, and others simply wait to have their buttons pushed so they can scream about it. It's really too bad that something that could be a positive force in the community is actually driving people apart. Although, like a train wreck, I just can't look away. I can't even stop posting there.
