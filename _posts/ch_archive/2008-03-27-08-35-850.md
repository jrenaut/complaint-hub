[The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Roberts deal appears unlikely](http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080326&content_id=2459061&vkey=spt2008news&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb)

> Baltimore manager Dave Trembley has consistently said that he can't imagine his batting order without Roberts, a switch-hitting fixture at the top of the lineup. However, he's also said that he'll do whatever he needs to do.

Now that they've said that Baltimore is unlikely to trade [Brian Roberts](http://www.baseball-reference.com/r/roberbr01.shtml), I expect a trade to come through in the next day or two. I mean, why wouldn't the Orioles get rid of a switch-hitting second baseman who stole 50 bases last year with a 112 OPS+ and happens to be one of the biggest fan favorites on the team? I mean, everyone in the league gets 42 doubles out of their second baseman, right? I know, it makes sense to deal him if you're rebuilding. And if the Orioles aren't rebuilding, then they're completely insane. I just don't see his value going up as the season progresses. The team is a mess, so I don't expect a career year out of him. The Orioles should probably take whatever the best offer is right now and call it a day.
