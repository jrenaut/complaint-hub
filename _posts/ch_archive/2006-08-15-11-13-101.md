[The Truth About Cars Chevrolet Uplander](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/?p=2013) This review is funny in part because I'm ashamed of American car companies and their continued quest to not provide anything useful to the world beyond jobs for factory workers, so I like hearing GM-bashing. But it's also funny for phrases like "execrable automotive aardvark" and "the Uplander's plastics seem designed by rental car companies for rental car companies; their ability to withstand endless applications of industrial strength ammonia being their only saving grace.". I think most phrases with the word "execrable" are funny. That's because it sounds like "excrement"! Or looks like it. Or something. Great. This is the 100th post on Complaint Hub, and I'm making poop jokes.
