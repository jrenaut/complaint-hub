Wow. Another [email from Dell](/node/877). The best part are these consecutive passages: 

> . . . I will provide you the information.

> As a Customer Care I am unable to provide you the information . . .

Please don't think that my anger here is because Dell has outsourced their customer service. I truly don't care if the CSR is in the United States or India or the moon or anywhere else. I don't care what his or her first language is. The only thing that's important to me in a CSR is being able to fix my problem, preferably in a minimal amount of time. That's it. Hence the anger. None of the people who emailed me could fix my problem. What's even more exasperating is that each of them has chastised me for asking my question to the wrong person. It's a little frustrating to be directed to talk to a person who tells me that he or she is not the person who can help me. Anyway, I'll get a computer eventually. And I still hate Dell.
