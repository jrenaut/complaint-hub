Orioles rookie [Chris Waters](http://minors.baseball-reference.com/players.cgi?pid=15372), so green he doesn't even have a Baseball-Reference.com major league page yet, made his debut last night in the bigs, making the Angels look silly. He opened his career by striking out [Chone Figgins](http://minors.baseball-reference.com/players.cgi?pid=4760) on three pitches. Unfortunately, the wife and I only watched the first five innings - the game was in LA/Anaheim/Sacramento/whatever and didn't start until 10 Eastern. But Waters didn't need us - 8 innings, one hit, three walks, and a hit batter. No runs. That sure takes away the sting of Brandon Fahey's demotion. Anyway, despite the fact that he's making his debut just shy of his 28th birthday, and the small sample size, I'm going to go ahead and call him a first ballot Hall of Famer. I predict he'll give up his first earned run sometime in 2011 (and it won't be his fault), become the first pitcher in years to win 30 games in a season, and cure cancer with his curveball.
