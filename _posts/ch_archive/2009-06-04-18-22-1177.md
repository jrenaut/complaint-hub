Our [honeymoon registry website](/blog/do-you-need-a-free-custom-honeymoon-registry) recorded its first transaction today for a person we don't know. The registry for our first customers has done well, but we know them. Well, I don't, but the other guy who built most of the website knows them. Today was the first time someone we don't know had something purchased from their registry. For the record, it was $100 towards "A visit to [Doi Suthep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Doi_Suthep), Chiang Mai's most famous temple, located on a hill overlooking the city". [Chiang Mai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Mai), for those that don't know (I had to Google it) is a city in northern Thailand. It's pretty exciting. The website we built because it seemed like a cool idea is actually getting some use. Not a lot, yet, but some. So, remember, if you need a [free custom honeymoon registry](http://www.aftertheidos.com), you know where to go.
