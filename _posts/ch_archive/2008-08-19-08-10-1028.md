The [Devil] Rays played the Angels last night. The Rays came into the game 75-48, tied with the Cubs for the second best record in the Majors. They were behind only the Angels at 76-46. This is a 1.5 game differential. So why on earth is the headline on the front page of ESPN.com for [this article](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280818130) **Rays top MLB-best Angels**? If the Rays were their normal selves, sitting 25 games out, then sure, this is significant. But do you know what they call it when the second best team in the league beats the best team in the league? They call that _baseball_. Or _normal_. I probably wouldn't have mentioned it, but I'm already annoyed with ESPN for their full page splash screen ads that have been popping up recently. Of course, now I'm possibly sending a little bit of traffic their way, so this is probably a pretty stupid response to my annoyance. But never mind.
