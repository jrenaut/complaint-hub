Have I mentioned that people who take the time to write little scripts or whatever it is they do to spam the comments at this blog and others deserve to be hit by buses? I don't quite know why this bothers me so much. It feels like an invasion of privacy. I love when people comment here. I love that people actually do enjoy what I write, and I welcome comments, whether you agree with me or not. But I do wish, with all my heart, that those responsible for comment spam and all other types of spam would die. This is not hyperbole. I wish death upon them. The world would be better off. If only Dante were alive now so that he could write them into _The Inferno_. They'd be sitting on top of Satan's head, screaming offers for cheap V14gr4 at the tortured souls all around them.

What may be even worse is the people who actually buy from them. It must be profitable, or they'd quit. Please, anyone reading this, never, EVER EVER EVER buy ANYTHING from a spammer. If you get an email trying to sell you something, it IS A SCAM. No exceptions. It's only going to get worse if you keep encouraging them.
