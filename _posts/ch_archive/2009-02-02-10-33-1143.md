The kid is starting daycare today. We left her this morning a little after 8, and I'll go get her around 2. It was hard, and we feel like awful parents. But we know it will get better. Plus, she's easily the cutest baby in her class (And even an unbiased observer would _have_ to admit that). So she'll get lots of attention.
