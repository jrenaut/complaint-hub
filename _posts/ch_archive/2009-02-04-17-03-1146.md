[An article at Deadspin](http://deadspin.com/5145778/hey-did-you-and-i-just-buy-santonio-holmes-a-new-cadillac-escalade) points out that GM gave Super Bowl MVP Santonio Holmes a car, but didn't publicize it like they have in previous years. 

> Fact: Santonio Holmes made more than $2 million this season. Fact: The federal government just bailed out General Motors to the tune of $9.4 billion. So, why is GM giving Holmes an $85,000 Cadillac Escalade Hybrid Platinum, which has been, in effect, purchased by the taxpayers?

A [commentor](http://deadspin.com/people/NineSevenOh/) mentions that this is even _worse_ than not giving him the car. I had this thought, too. Seriously, I swear I thought of if before I saw the comment. I went and looked at the comment thread because I figured I wouldn't be the only one. Surely in the past, GM figured that the relatively low cost of an Escalade compared with the promotional value of being on the field just after the Super Bowl was a worthwhile marketing effort. They were probably right. But now, they've still spent the money, but the only way that Escalade gets in the news is if Holmes gets arrested in it.
