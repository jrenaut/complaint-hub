I just spent the last 15 minutes stuck in an elevator. This is the second time I've been stuck in an elevator in this stupid building.

I went down to G2, where Target is, so I could pick up a few things.  I took them back down (via the stairs) to G3 and put them in the trunk.  Then I got on the elevator to go back up to my floor, and nothing happened.  So I used the emergency call box, and some nice woman on the other end asked me to press some buttons, which did nothing.  So she called the building maintenance people, and they came pretty quickly and opened the door.  I suspect I could have done it myself - I pried the door open a little bit without too much difficulty.  But I've seen _Resident Evil_.  I'm not messing with an elevator unless I don't think someone is going to come get me.

This wouldn't be a problem if you could use the stairs.  You can walk freely on the stairs between G3 and G1.  You can enter the stairwell from any floor, but you can only exit the stairs on one side at the lobby, and on the other through G1-3.  You can't go from G1 to the lobby.  It's ridiculous.  I would walk most of the time if I could, and I do, when I'm going down.  But going up you can't walk.

I hate this building.  And all elevators.
