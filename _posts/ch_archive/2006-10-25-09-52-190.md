[![Dusty hallway](http://static.flickr.com/113/278704012_877634aa34.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/278704012/)When I moved in to my condo, the seller swore that we could easily paint over the ugly venetian plaster he'd had put up. "But, of course, you'd never want to", he said. I beg to differ. Brown bamboo floors and brown walls just don't do it for me. So the wife and I painted over the walls, and it just peels right off. Now that we're trying to sell, we're sanding the stupid walls so we can paint them. We tested a little spot, and sanding actually makes the primer stick.

Unfortunately, sanding also makes a horrific mess. I'm at work now, and my hands still feel like they have plaster dust on them. And I haven't sanded anything since last night. I've taken TWO showers since I touched a sander.

Oh, well.  I think we can finish sanding tonight or tomorrow, then we'll paint, and forget this horrible dusty mess.  The cat will no doubt appreciate that, as well, so she can go back to being black again.
