[WALL-E: Cute robot or liberal propaganda? - ParentDish](http://www.parentdish.com/2008/07/03/wall-e-cute-robot-or-liberal-propaganda/)  


> "From the first moment of the film," wrote Shannen Coffin, former general counsel to Vice President Cheney, "my kids were bombarded with leftist propaganda about the evils of mankind."

So, Wall-E has been described as "a 90-minute lecture on the dangers of over consumption, big corporations, and the destruction of the environment." The cynic in me is wondering if the blogs I read, predominantly pretty liberal, pick up on that, and overstate how good the movie is because it speaks to some of the issues they believe in. That is, it's getting "good movie" points for "good message". It's only natural to come away with a more positive perception of anything - a movie, a person, a work of art, whatever - if that thing supports views you already hold. I certainly don't mean to imply that the reviewers of Wall-E are being dishonest, even unconsciously. But it's something to think about. Especially if the conservative reviewers consistently have lower opinions of the movie. I guess I'd have to check out some of them to be sure.
