It is absolutely absurd that Michigan and Florida are even considering spending $25 million and $10 million, respectively, of taxpayer money to [hold new elections](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/06/AR2008030604071.html?nav=rss_email/components). It is unfortunate that Democrats in these two states will not get to contribute to the selection of the nominee this year. But we can't punish the Democratic party leaders of each state by throwing them in the briar patch at taxpayer expense. The whole reason they knowingly violated the rules was to give their states a louder voice in the election process. They were told they couldn't move up the primaries, and that they would be punished if they did. They ignored the warnings, and they were punished. If we now let them revote, we're giving them exactly what they wanted. I'm not sure why the media doesn't seem to find this absurd. I think Florida and Michigan should send delegates bound by the proportion of delegates already pledged. That is, if Obama has 53% of the delegates from the other states, then he gets 53% of Florida's and 53% of Michigan's. That should get someone to the magic number (I think - I haven't actually looked at the numbers) without giving Florida and Michigan any real influence on the election.
