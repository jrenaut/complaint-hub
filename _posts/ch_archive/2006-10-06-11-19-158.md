I work in a nine-story building, made up of primarily government and military contractors.  As one would expect, there is a men's room (And a women's room, though I've never been inside) on my floor.  There is currently a man in the men's room, shirtless, drying himself with a hair dryer.  Let me say again that he is completely shirt-free. I believe this is inappropriate in a semi-public restroom.  There are probably eight offices on my floor, so he probably won't know most of the people who might come in to the men's room.  Although knowing them might make it worse.

Anyway, am I being ridiculous?  Is this just an unlucky guy who got rained on while coming to work, and he's trying to make the best of it?
