The new [Tor.com](http://www.tor.com) beta has launched. Despite signing up with them months ago, when they promised free goodies for getting on the mailing list, they seem to have forgotten to notify me of the opening. They did come through with the free goodies - I have a few dozen free ebooks to read as soon as someone makes a stinkin' ebook reader that doesn't suck. And now they have new short stories from [John Scalzi](http://scalzi.com/whatever/) and [Charles Stross](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/index.html), which is cool. But I didn't hear about the launch from Tor, I heard about it from [John Scalzi's blog](http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=1049). What's the point of signing up for the early mailing list if you aren't informed when the new site goes live? And why did they do it on a Sunday when no one is paying attention? And why didn't I already have a username and password? I don't remember if I signed up for one when I got on the mailing list, but I should have, and they should remember it. I haven't poked around on the site yet, so I can't speak to what it's like, but after all this buildup, the launch itself has been pretty disappointing. Hopefully they'll iron out the wrinkles and end up with a nice site. I suspect that they will. So now I'm off to check out the site.
