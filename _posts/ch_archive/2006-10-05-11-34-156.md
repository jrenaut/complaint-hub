[Techdirt: Diebold's Solution To E-Voting Problems: Beg Poll Workers Not To Touch Touchscreens](http://techdirt.com/articles/20061005/001418.shtml)

> The state ran a daylong test, and found plenty of problems still to overcome -- including the same problems with the e-poll books that caused all sorts of delays during the election.

For any of you living in Maryland, do not use a Diebold machine to vote this November.  Demand something else.  I don't know what legal rights you may have, but there must be some alternative voting method for people who can't use the touchscreen (The blind, for example).  Call your congressperson, your senator, your mayor, governor, whatever you have to do.  Voting is way too important to be left to a company like Diebold that refuses to provide a working product.
