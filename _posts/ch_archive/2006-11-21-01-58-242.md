Today at work, and I don't even remember how it came up, we were talking about a movie that one of my coworkers saw.  It's about some guys who use a time machine to go back and hunt dinosaurs.  One of them accidentally kills a butterfly, and this has profound effects on the time in the future that they then return to.  He couldn't remember the name of the movie.

So I type "dinosaur butterfly movie" into my handy little Firefox Google search bar.  The second hit takes me to a page that currently isn't coming up (Although Google has a [cache](http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:owPixt5Z9mwJ:www.starseeker.com/films/soundoft.htm+dinosaur+butterfly+movie&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=2)) that gives the plot of the movie, "A Sound of Thunder", based on a Ray Bradbury story.  The page came up this afternoon when I first looked for it, though. What did we do before Google?  I don't even know.  But I've gotten used to this instant location of whatever I need using only a vague idea of what it is to find it.

For reference, the first Yahoo result that refers to the movie is the fourth, and it's for a Boston Globe review trashing the movie.  MSN returns as the first hit the Wikipedia page for the Bradbury story, which references the movie.  But I don't use their searches, because they suck.  Although Yahoo hasn't killed [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) yet.  I do give them credit for that.
