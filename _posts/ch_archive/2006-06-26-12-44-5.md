I'm home from work today due to the power outage. Apparently the DC area got six inches of rain this weekend, most of it last night, and now the whole area is a bit of a mess. I'm supposed to be working from home, but there's not much I can do without access to the servers, and so I'm awaiting instruction. And by that I mean awaiting the start of the Italy-Australia game.

This morning, I made the switch from [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) to [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org). It seems cooler. The template I got from WordPress is certainly nicer than what I had before. And there's a lot of stuff I don't know how to do yet with WordPress, so I'll probably be playing with that today.

And now, a complaint - the traffic lights at [Seven Corners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Corners,_Virginia) weren't changing this morning. Now, Seven Corners, on a good day, is a miserable place to be. When the traffic lights are on, but never change, and there's no police presence to keep order, it's a disaster. Not as big a disaster as Metro seems to be, but a disaster nevertheless.

Edit: It's pouring again.
