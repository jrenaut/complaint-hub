The Lakers won Game 3 at home last night, to the surprise of pretty much no one. However, if you're a Lakers fan, you can't possibly be happy with that game. Paul Pierce was in foul trouble the whole game, and wasn't hitting his shots when he was in the game. Garnett didn't shoot well. And it still took 20 points from Sasha Vujacic to beat Boston. I'm going to go ahead and go out on a limb and say that he doesn't repeat that performance in this series. In any event, I feel good about the series. Pierce (2 for 14) and Garnett (6 for 21) will play better tomorrow. Kobe got to the line plenty of times and still didn't dominate the game like the announcers keep saying he will. By the way, I am pretty tired of hearing about him the entire game. He is being _contained_. 36 points is nice, but nothing special for him, and he had one assist. If Odom and Gasol don't step it up, this is going to be a tough run for the Lakers when Vujacic, Pierce, and Garnett go back to normal.
