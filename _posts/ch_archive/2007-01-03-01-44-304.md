Due to a little investigating after seeing it in my Google analytics reports, I am now able to tell you that, happily, Complaint Hub is the #1 Google result for the phrase "[Internet Explorer is the devil](http://www.google.com/search?q=internet+explorer+is+the+devil)".  That makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.

This is also my 300th post.  I guess that's cool, too.
