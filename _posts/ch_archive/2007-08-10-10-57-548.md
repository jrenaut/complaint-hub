There are two buildings on our street that have been abandoned since we moved in last February, and it looks like renovation has started on both.  Work on the abandoned row house will begin this Monday, according to the developer.  And there is a work permit hanging on the side of the apartment building, although I didn't really read it because it was starting to rain.

I'm curious how the housing market is going to look in a year or so when these places are finished (hopefully).  DC USA should be open by then, but so should the surrounding apartments and condos.

Still, it's exciting that the eyesores will be going away.  The first thing I would do with the row house, were I the developer, is paint over the profanity that someone has spray-painted on the front steps.  I think that would go a long way towards making the place look a little nicer.

I'm going to take some pictures of the buildings this weekend so I can compare them to the finished product when construction is complete.
