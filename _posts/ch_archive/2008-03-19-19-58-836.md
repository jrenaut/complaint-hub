I [wrote about this](node/770) a little while ago, and now Boing Boing says, [Copyfighters beat down Tennessee bill](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/19/copyfighters-beat-do.html). Well done, Tennessee. People in the comments point out that this is not a total victory - it still requires universities to police their students, which is a dumb idea. But at least it's no longer a horrible, despicable idea.
