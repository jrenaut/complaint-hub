[SI.com - NFL - Saban declines offer from Bush - Monday July 31, 2006 1:26PM](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/football/nfl/07/31/bc.fbn.bush.saban.ap/index.html)

> "It was really a tough decision," Saban said. "I feel like my first responsibility is our team. That in no way disrespects the importance of the opportunity I would have loved to have had to spend dinner with the President."

Apparently getting the Dolphins ready for the season takes up every minute of his time.  I suspect that this is either exaggeration on the part of an AP reporter trying to drum up some controversy, or Saban is a Democrat and thinks his fame means we care about his snub of the President.  Oh, wait, I just wrote about it, I guess I do care.
