[Complaint: Dumbass Major League Baseball](http://www.submissions.complainthub.com/complaint/show/33)

> There is no reason to freaking block a game because it's on ESPN. IDIOTS!

So, one of my more obnoxious friends has been badgering me to upgrade the [Your Complaints](http://submissions.complainthub.com) section of Complaint Hub for a while.  I haven't done it because I'm lazy.  He wants to be able to reply to complaints.  I've told him to go to [Ventbox](http://www.ventbox.com), but he ignores me.

One of these days I'll get around to it.  Probably not this week.  But one of these days.
