I just made my first visit of the year to the [Nanowrimo](http://www.nanowrimo.org) forums.  The minute I read about people planning their novel and outlining a plot and creating characters, I just can't help myself.

There are certainly worse things to be addicted to.  Crack.  Sex.  World of Warcraft.  I just have Nano.  And complaining.  Always complaining.

I need to start my planning.  When I plan more, my novels turn out better.  I think.  I have the first two or three chapters vaguely in my head, but I need a lot more than that.  And I need some names.  And that's where you, dear readers, come in.  I know it's hard to name people you know nothing about, so as I do more planning, I'll try and bring you some character descriptions, and you can suggest names.  I hate naming characters, and I'm generally not all that happy with the names I end up with (Although Polly the Duck from Nano 2005 was nice).

So, stay tuned for your chance to name my characters.
