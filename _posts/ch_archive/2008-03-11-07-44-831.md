[Spitzer Linked To Prostitution Ring by Wiretap - washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/10/AR2008031001482.html)

> New York Gov. Eliot L. Spitzer's political future was thrown in doubt yesterday after he was identified as an anonymous client heard on a federal wiretap arranging to pay money and buy train tickets for a high-priced New York prostitute to meet him at a downtown Washington hotel.

Dear Eliot Spitzer: You're a jerk. You got busted because OUR PROSTITUTES WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU. I hope you're happy. Love, Washington DC
