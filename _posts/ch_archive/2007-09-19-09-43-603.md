[Columbia Heights News - Washington, DC - Columbia Heights Day - October 6](http://www.columbiaheightsnews.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=252&Itemid=49)

> The First Annual Columbia Heights Day Festival is scheduled for Saturday, October 6th from 11 AM to 6 PM.

But hey, at least we're having a Columbia Heights Day.  Not much detail at CH News, or at the [CH Day website](http://www.columbiaheightsday.org/index.htm).  But there's supposed to be a meeting of local business owners tonight, so maybe after that they'll have a better idea of what's happening.  They're not giving themselves a whole lot of time.
