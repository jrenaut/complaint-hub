Fresh on the heels of [The Assassin's Gate: America in Iraq](http://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Gate-America-Iraq/dp/0374530556/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-9716202-3427912?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1176326329&sr=8-1), a new book arrived today from [Seashell books](http://www.seashellbooks.com) via [AbeBooks](http://www.abebooks.com/). While reading _The Assassin's Gate_, I realized that it would be much easier to understand what has been and still is going on in Iraq if I had a better understanding of Islam. And, perhaps, of the happy fairy world where George Bush and his band of lunatics live. But I don't think anyone has yet written a book on that. 

So, I wanted a book on Islam. My sometimes-moustached brother-in-law recommended [The History of Islam](http://www.amazon.com/History-Islam-Robert-Payne/dp/1566198526/ref=sr_1_1/104-9716202-3427912?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1176326777&sr=1-1).

It has a nice inscription in the front.

Too bad I'm not Pop. But I hope he enjoyed the book.

Anyway, I have another book to read before I get to this one, but I'm looking forward to reading it and understanding a little more about the religion and the culture behind it.
