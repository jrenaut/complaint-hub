Have you ever ridden in an elevator with a little TV screen provided by [The Captivate Network](http://www.captivate.com/)? There's one in the elevator at my office. I like to watch because it makes me forget that I'm in an elevator (As faithful readers know, I [hate elevators](/taxonomy/term/53)). It also occasionally has some interesting things, like little news tidbits and weather. Today, I was coming back from lunch, and the screen showed a "gadget review". They mentioned a 32" Samsung HD TV. They mentioned that it was perfect for any dorm room. At the bottom was the price. $850. What college student could possibly need an $850 television in his/her dorm? Do you know how big the TV was in my college dorm? 13 inches. And I turned out just fine. Seriously, parents, if you buy your college student an $850 TV, you are a bad parent. College is about being poor and trying to hook up with as many people as possible. If you're spending a lot of time in your room watching a huge TV, you're doing it wrong.
