[Bad Astronomy Blog](http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2008/05/25/first-light-pictures-from-phoenix/) and countless others are all over this, but it took seeing pictures to really get me excited. We just landed something on Mars that is going to try and find out if there is or was or could be life on the planet. That's pretty friggin' cool. The potential for life on Mars doesn't really excite me that much - it's not like we're going to meet E.T. or anything. The life we're hoping to find is either long dead or just a couple of cells. Scientifically fascinating and important if it's there, but not that big a deal for the average person. But Mars. It's incredible that we can actually put a little machine on the planet, and then have it do stuff and send back information. Kinda makes you wonder why there are still places you can't get decent cell phone reception.
