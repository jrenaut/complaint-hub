I don't think I know anyone who was on one of the [DC Metro trains that crashed today](http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/06/22/washington.subway.crash/index.html) - certainly the wife and kid and I were nowhere near it, and I've already spoken to the two people I know who might have been near that station. I hope your family and friends are all okay, too.
