The baby has not yet arrived. The official due date is tomorrow, so that's not exactly a surprise, but believe me when I tell you that the wife is ready. I'm pretty ready, too. What has arrived, though, is a big package of onesies from the wife's family. Pictured here is the creation of one of the baby's uncles-to-be. Please excuse the trademark-infringement. It really is the sincerest form of flattery. And [Bell's](http://www.bellsbeer.com) doesn't actually sell onesies, so he's not taking away a sale. The Bell's Octoberfest, by the way, is quite nice. I recommend you try it if it's available in your area. And if you work for Bell's and are reading this because it showed up on your traffic logs, why not offer onesies? I can't speak for everyone, but we'd definitely buy some.
