My [Akismet](http://www.akismet.com) spam filter on the comments here at Complaint Hub has been letting me down lately. In general, it has been fantastic. It's caught about 8,000 spam comments since I started the site, and only caught maybe three or four real posts. But lately it has been holding more and more spam comments in moderation, emailing me and making me tell it that the comment is spam.

Some of what it's been letting through are quite obviously spam. The latest was a brief message and then forty links to hardcore porn.

I hope this means that Akismet is just nearing the next step in their release cycle, and the spammers are getting better at fooling the filter, but all will be back to normal soon. I hate captchas, and don't ever want to use one here, so a filter like Akismet is a necessity.

If Dante were writing The Inferno today, what [circle of Hell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Divine_Comedy#The_Circles_of_Hell) do you think he'd put the spammers into? I'd throw them into the Eighth circle with the panderers (_a person who serves or caters to the vulgar passions or plans of others (especially in order to make money [[source](http://www.wordreference.com/definition/panderer)])_. There they would walk in a line, being whipped by demons. That seems appropriate.
