My [baby brother](http://srenaut.blogspot.com/) is leaving today for law school on the other side of the country. It's a pretty mixed feeling for me. On one hand, I'm obviously happy and excited for him. Law school is a great opportunity, and it should be a great experience, and I'm glad he's figuring out what he wants to do with his life. On the other hand, I'd kind of gotten used to him being close by, playing on the flag football team, and all that. Plus, he'll be in Arizona when his first niece or nephew is born next month. Luckily, I'll be at happy hour when his plane leaves today, so I can have a drink for him. I think he'll appreciate that.
