[Metro Use A Rarity For Half Of Board | WashingtonPost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/21/AR2009022101667.html?sid=ST2009022101772&sub=AR)

So, what they're saying here is, "We're so grossly incompetent that we can't even make Metro work for ourselves. Good luck to all you poor schlubs!" What kind of schedule do these people keep that Metro isn't convenient? I don't believe that they have Metro board meetings at 4AM on Sundays. Seriously, this is like the CEO of Bank of America keeping his life savings under his mattress because the branches are too inconvenient. Maybe the reason that Metro has a $29 million deficit is because it's not serving the residents of the DC Metro area. And maybe the people responsible for fixing it could actually use it and see for themselves what the problems are. Instead, they'll probably just raise fares again, making it less convenient for everyone. Next year we'll have a $40 million deficit, and more people who don't use it will make more bad decisions.
