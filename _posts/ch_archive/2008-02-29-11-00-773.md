[Green Cell Eco-Concept: One Battery For All](http://gizmodo.com/362249/green-cell-eco+concept-one-battery-for-all)

> Green Cell is a concept with a single simple idea: use safe, standardized rechargeable batteries in all portable gadgets.

I've argued this before - it's ridiculous that every single portable device uses it's own battery and charger. Even within the same company they often aren't compatible. Nokia used to do it with their 5000 series cell phones, but I think they've gotten away from it. Anyway, this would be really cool if it happened. I don't think it will, but it would be cool.
