Finally a response from the Kennedy Center to [my complaints](?p=538).

So, all I had to do was complain to the FTC.  I would have appreciated an explanation of why they thought it was okay to violate the CAN-SPAM act, but maybe that's too much to ask.  Maybe they could have told me why I had to complain three times before I got a response. 

Well, at least they responded.
