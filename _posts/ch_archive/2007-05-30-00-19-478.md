On June 9th, I'm doing my second 10K.  The [first one](http://www.blog.complainthub.com/?p=464) was a success.  This one is going to be hotter, and I'm going to the [DC Improv](http://www.dcimprov.com/comics/john_witherspoon.html) the night before, so I should be all ready to run at 8 AM.  Then we have our flag football end-of-season barbeque.  Should be a good weekend.  I may sleep all day Sunday, though.

I have to wonder how much this race actually helps the American Heart Association.  It costs $30 to sign up.  I get a t-shirt.  They have to pay some people to run the event.  I can't believe that any more than $5 per person actually goes to help the cause.

On the other hand, I'm really running this race for me.  If I want to help a charity, I'd rather just give them money.
