[![DSC_5755](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/250/516073320_4cda85478a_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/516073320/)On Saturday, the wife wanted to go to [Dumbarton Oaks](http://www.doaks.org/Gardens.html) to see the gardens. It was a nice day, so we hopped on the 42 bus down to Dupont Circle. The park is at 31st and R NW, so we figured we'd just walk down R, only about ten blocks.

Well, it appears we misread the map or something, because R doesn't go all the way through. We hit Mass and headed north, past all the embassies, around the Naval Observatory, and finally into Georgetown. By this time we were hot, tired, and hungry, so we stopped for lunch at The Bean Counter on Wisconsin. I don't know if it was just that the restaurant was air conditioned and we were starving, but that sandwich was delicious.  The service was good, too.

Then, we finally made it to the garden.  It's a nice self-tour.  There's a map, so the wife was happy.  They have a ton of roses, including the one up and to the right.

When we finally made it home, we determined (using [Map My Run](http://www.mapmyrun.com)) that we'd walked about 5 and a half miles.  I think maybe next time we'll take the bus a little closer to 31st and R.
