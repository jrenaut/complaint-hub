[![Steak, fries, beer](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/229/510228901_fd0cc4fd07_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/510228901/) The wife is in Vegas for work, so I'm left on my own until Thursday. Last night, I cooked a frozen pizza for dinner, but tonight, I thought I'd do something a little nicer. When I was in college and lived near my paternal grandmother, she used to cook me dinner sometimes. It was nearly always the same thing. Steak, steak fries, and peas. She always had Coke to drink, and always had something for dessert. Here I've substituted a Red Hook Long Hammer IPA for the Coke, and I was too lazy to cook the peas, but the rest of the dinner is all there.

I made a pretty big greasy mess of the stove, and I overcooked the steak, but it was immensely satisfying nonetheless. The wife, apparently, is going to a sushi buffet with some coworkers tonight, and ordinarily I would be jealous. But not tonight.

I do miss the wife, but she'll be back soon, and I also appreciate the time alone. The cat and I are hanging out (she was helping me cook. And by "helping me cook" I mean "poking around in the trash and sniffing the bit of leftover gristle in there"), watching some tv, and enjoying our freedom.
