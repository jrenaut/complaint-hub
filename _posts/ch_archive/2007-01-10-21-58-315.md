Wife and I are off to a fancy dinner tonight at [Mendocino](http://www.mendocinodc.com/), booked through [OpenTable](http://www.opentable.com). Can't wait for some nice fish, maybe some organic wine . . .

I know you all are jealous.

Edit:  Totally worth it. I'd highly recommend Mendocino. Dinner was great. Nice, small restaurant, good service, right in the heart of super-trendy Georgetown. Georgetown is actually so trendy that I don't think it's trendy anymore - it's gone totally back around to only semi-cool.  The wife says, "Great company.  But I guess I can get that anywhere.  I would recommend the goat cheese cheesecake".
