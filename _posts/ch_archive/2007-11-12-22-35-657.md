Whew, am I behind.  I got a little behind on Thursday because we had a friend come into town.  Then I got a little more behind on Friday.  Then on Saturday I woke up at 4:30AM puking, I have no idea why, and didn't stop until around noon.  After that, it was all I could do to just stay awake, much less write.  Then the wife of the friend joined him (she's a friend, too, but it's easier to say it this way), and we hung out on Sunday, so as of this morning, I was nearly 5,000 words behind the pace.  I've never been that far behind, unless you count 2004 when I only wrote 448 words on day one.

On the bright side, I've written 3,058 words today, and am only about to break for dinner.  The Monday Night Football game is going to be disgracefully bad, so I should be able to write through that.  And I'm only 1,741 words behind schedule now.  I can make that up this week.
