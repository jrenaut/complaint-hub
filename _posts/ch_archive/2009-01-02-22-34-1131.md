I still don't seem to be getting this whole "partition for a multi-boot Linux system" thing. Or maybe I just need to install [OpenSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org) before [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com). Whatever the problem is, I have only one OS installed at the moment, OpenSUSE 11.1, but at least this time it recognized my wireless card without any issues. However, it can't handle Flash on 64-bit Firefox. This is a big giant obstacle to OpenSUSE becoming an operating system that normal people can use. I'm enough of a geek that I'll figure out how to get Flash working. But most people aren't, and no matter how much I hate Adobe for forcing their horrible proprietary language on the world, and how mad I am at the world for letting them do it, _you can't be a mainstream operating system if your default browser doesn't support Flash out of the box_. You can do what Ubuntu does and give open source options to people who refuse to put anything proprietary on their machine, but you can't make people go download tar.gz files from Adobe and then be told that their architecture isn't supported. Like it or not, Flash is a part of the internet experience. You have to find a way to deal with that, and OpenSUSE hasn't. Other than that, I kind of like it. The equivalent of the Windows Start Menu is interesting, and clearly the result of looking at Windows and trying to do one better. Once I get [Gnome-Do](http://do.davebsd.com/) installed, I may never use it again, but many people will, and it looks like they've done some cool things with it. The experiment continues. Edit to add: [And here's the script to install 64-bit Flash in Firefox on OpenSUSE 11.x](http://www.myscienceisbetter.info/2008/11/install-native-64bit-flash-player-10-on-linux.html), in case you wanted to know.
