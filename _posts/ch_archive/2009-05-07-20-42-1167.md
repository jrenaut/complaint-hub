When I got married, we had a honeymoon registry. We had both been living on our own for a while, and then together for a bit, and so we had a lot of the things that people typically put on a wedding registry. It was fantastic for us - because so much of the honeymoon was paid for, we felt free to splurge a bit on things like a helicopter tour of [the Twelve Apostles](http://www.visitvictoria.com/displayobject.cfm/objectid.000B0BDC-CFBC-1A5C-BC6180C476A90000/) and mass quantities of wine in downtown Melbourne. A [friend](http://www.vinotrip.com) and his wife did the same thing for their wedding. It was easy for us because both of us are software guys, and know how to build a website. It may not be easy for you. That's why he and I created [After the I Dos](http://www.aftertheidos.com). It's a totally free (except for Paypal fees) honeymoon registry site. You can set up a registry and let your guests help finance your honeymoon. I mean, do you _really_ need another set of towels? Wouldn't you rather let your guests help pay for your skydiving adventure, wine tour, resort, or whatever you plan on doing for your honeymoon? All you need is a few minutes to set it up and a (free) Paypal account. You'll get a website you can send out to your guests, and you can even show links to your other registry sites, or maybe your wedding site at [The Knot](http://www.theknot.com) or whatever. An added benefit is ease of thank-you notes. All you need to do is take a picture of you and your spouse doing whatever it is the person helped pay for, print a copy for 12 cents at Target, and write a quick note about how much fun you had. No more making excuses for why you haven't used that expensive food processor that Aunt Greta bought you.
