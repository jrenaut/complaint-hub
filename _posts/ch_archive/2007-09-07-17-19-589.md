The wife and I had a little date night last night, having dinner at [Coppi's](http://www.coppisorganic.com/) on U Street and then drinks at [Saint Ex](http://www.saint-ex.com/home.html) on 14th.

Coppi's was courtesy of my [occasionally blogging brother-in-law](http://sagestache.blogspot.com) (As opposed to the others who don't blog at all) and his girlfriend, who stayed with us a little while back, and were overly generous in expressing their gratitude.

In any event, Coppi's was great. I beat the wife there by a bit, which meant I sat at the bar, chatted with a woman who was probably the manager, and drank an organic beer.

Then the wife arrived. We each had a salad and an entree, all delicious, and then shared a dessert. My salad was the Bietole al Forno, which was very good. For dinner I had a really nice lasagne. It was a bit more cream sauce than red sauce, which would not have been my first choice, but was very good anyway.

And then we shared the dessert. It's not on their online menu, but it was recommended by the waiter. It was peaches with a wine and brown sugar sauce topped with ice cream, and it was quite good.

As for the restaurant itself, it was a great experience. The service was excellent, the place crowded but not uncomfortably so, and the music was eclectic and interesting.  I would highly recommend them for dinner.  Reservations are probably a good idea.

I've been to Saint Ex before.  It's one of the wife's favorite bars.  And it was, again, a nice place to hang out.
