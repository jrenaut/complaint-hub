You know what I hate?  No, the other thing.  I hate [Cox Communications](http://www.cox.com)' annoying mascot "Digital Max".  I just saw a commercial that thankfully didn't feature him about how wonderful Cox's customer service is.  I can't believe that's true, but since I haven't had to call them, I can't really say it isn't good.  Their prices sure aren't very good, but neither are anyone else's because of the barriers to competition in the cable tv market.

Anyway, for me, the best thing they could do to make me happy as a customer (Which I'll only be until I move - I think DC is Comcast) is make a little flash game called "Dismember Digital Max" where I could choose from a variety of weapons and then chop Max up into little tiny bits.  Extra points for creatively gory animations.

It would probably be for the best if I didn't watch any TV tonight.
