[Mystery odor permeates Manhattan](http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/08/ny.gas.odor.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories)

> "One thing we are very confident of, it's not dangerous," New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference.

We don't know what it is, but we know it isn't dangerous. Thanks, Mayor Bloomberg. Sorry to all of you who live in Manhattan. That's got to be rough on you. 

> "If you were in a gas station, [the odor] would be magnified 1,000 times," NEW JERSEY mayor's spokeswoman Maria Pignataro told CNN.

At least it's not terrorism. Not sure how they're ruling that out without knowing what the smell is, but maybe they have advanced terrorism identification techniques that are too secret to inform the public of their existence.
