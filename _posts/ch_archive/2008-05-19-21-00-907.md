Is there some reason I'm not aware of for New Orleans fans booing the Spurs every time they touch the ball? I mean, I'm all for supporting your team. And I'm fine with some booing here and there. When an opposing player insults your town or your team, boo him. That's part of being a fan. But when you boo the Spurs every time they touch the ball, when you boo Tim friggin' Duncan, who helps opponents up off the floor, you are bad fans. I had been on the fence on this series because I frankly don't care about either team, but Chris Paul is pretty amazing, and Duncan has been very good for a good while. But now I'm rooting for the Spurs. I know New Orleans has been through a lot as a city in the last few years, and I have no idea what that's like, but it's no excuse for being just awful fans. I've never heard so much booing.
