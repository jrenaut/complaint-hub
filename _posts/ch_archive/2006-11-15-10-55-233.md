I got used to having political stuff to talk about all the time, and now there doesn't seem to be much going on.  I'm sure there is, but it's not plastered all over the front page anymore, and I haven't taken the time to go find it.

It was as if everyone let out a collective sigh of relief - "Oh, the Democrats took both majorities, now they'll fix everything."  Sure, that would be cool.  But it's not going to happen right away.  I think it's important that we, the people, continue to pay attention and put pressure on our representatives to do what they've promised.  You want us out of Iraq?  Tell your representatives that we need plan, now, that gets Iraq stable and self-sufficient so we can get the heck out of there.  Is illegal immigration your issue?  Tell them that Bush's big wall is a stupid idea, and we need to figure out a way to deal with this that doesn't involve racist Texans shooting at Mexicans.  There's a whole lot of compromising room between amnesty and deportation of all.

I know I've been slacking, but November is really busy.  I promise to write a letter to a representative (I'm thinking new VA Senator Jim Webb) the first week in December.  I don't know what I'm going to write, but I'll write something.
