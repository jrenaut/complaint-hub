I know my opinion on Apple and the iPhone differs from many of my readers, but this is worrisome if you've bought an iPhone and mistakenly think you've bought an app from the App Store. [Engadget | iPhone hacker says the device 'calls home' to Apple, allows apps to be remotely disabled](http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/07/iphone-hacker-says-the-device-calls-home-to-apple-allows-apps/)

> the suggestion that a process of the OS would actively monitor, report on, and possibly deactivate your device's software is unreasonable, and clearly presents an issue that the company will have to deal with sooner or later.

If you buy something, and the seller can take it back at any time for any reason and not give back your money, you are renting, not buying. Because of the closed and proprietary nature of Apple's world, if you buy into it, you're stuck with whatever they want to do to you. Updated to add: [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/08/your-iphone-probably-isnt-calling-home-just-might-not-want-you/) says that the iPhone probably isn't calling home to disable your apps after all. I still don't like Apple, and I still don't trust them any more than I trust Microsoft. But it doesn't seem like they're doing anything objectionable here.
