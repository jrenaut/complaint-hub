I had a bit of a scary moment this morning - I walked into the office, and suddenly the unmistakable smell of cat urine hit me like a ton of bricks.  At first I thought maybe it was me.  I mean, I do have an occasionally salty cat who quite possibly might decide to urinate on some of my clothes.  Although she's never done it.  She usually likes to express her displeasure by just barely missing the litter box.

But no, it's not me.  It's the office.  My office smells like cat urine.

How this happens is beyond me.  I don't work in a place that should ever contain a cat.  I don't think a cat could pass the security clearance.
