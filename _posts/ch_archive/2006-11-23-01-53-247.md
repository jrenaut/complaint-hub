I passed the 40,000 word mark earlier this evening.  I'm currently at 41,047.  For a little while the story was kind of sucking, but maybe I've saved it.  Maybe not.  It's not as good as my 2003 novel.  And it's not exactly what I had planned.  But it's not totally without positives.

I'm ready to be done, though.  There's a lot of stuff I've been kind of putting off that I'd like to stop putting off.  I read a short story by [Charles Stross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross) recently (I've read a few of his novels already), and it has me wanting to write science fiction.  The problem is that I don't know enough of the science to make the fiction work.  I don't want to make up stuff (Like I'm doing with this Nano novel).  I want far-future-but-realistic, if that makes any sense.  So I think I need to do some reading of some real science, and then I can take a shot at science fiction.

It would also be nice to be done because I think my wife has been a little neglected.  She's a good sport about it, but that doesn't mean I should push my luck.
