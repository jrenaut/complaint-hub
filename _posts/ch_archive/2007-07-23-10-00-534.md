Some of you may remember that I [contested a ridiculous parking ticket](/node/518) last month. I left the response letter at home, so I can't post it now, but I can summarize. 

> Dear Sir, Your relentless powers of persuasion are too much for us. We have tried to formulate a response, a scenario where you might possibly be in the wrong, even a little bit, but we have failed. As such, please do not pay us any money. We're sorry. Sincerely, DC Adjudication Services

I'm pretty sure that's almost word for word. I may have taken a few liberties and substituted a word here and there to get down to what they really meant, without the posturing and bureaucracy. We're still waiting on a response for the big ticket, the $100 ticket. The wife wrote that letter. She's a lawyer, so she should be better at convincing them, but we had a much stronger case on the one that I contested. So we'll see.
