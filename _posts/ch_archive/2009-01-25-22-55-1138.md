I've started up a [new blog](http://www.ebooksyearntobefree.com). It's not meant to replace this one - I plan to continue posting to both. But it is a new direction. I'm trying something a little more professional rather than whatever you might categorize this blog as. The new blog is about ebooks and ebook readers, and my intention is to see if I like writing something that's a little more journalistic and a little less whining about parking in DC. So, go [check it out](http://www.ebooksyearntobefree.com). Let me know what you think. Seriously, I'd love feedback. Is it mind-numbing? Do you want to punch me in the face? If you were in the market for an ebook reader, would you care what I had to say?
