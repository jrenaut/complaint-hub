[xkcd - A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language - COMPLY](http://www.xkcd.com/c77.html)

Found this on [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net).  A comic strip that that mentions the [Riemann-Zeta Function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function).  Awesome.

Well, the strip that I linked didn't mention it.  But another one did.  Still awesome.
