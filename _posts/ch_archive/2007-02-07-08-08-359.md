It's so disappointing when you find out at 10pm that you somehow missed the announcement that it was going to snow, and didn't notice the snow until there was almost an inch on the ground, but wake up the next morning to find that the streets are already clear.

So now you're just stuck with the occasional icy spot, a few dumb drivers, and no excuse to stay home from work. I hear lots of people say, "Oh, it's not the roads you have to worry about, it's the other drivers." I think that's a pretty pathetic excuse. There are ALWAYS stupid drivers trying to kill you. One woman did it to me this morning. Somehow, her red light and my green turn arrow meant she could go right into the lane I was turning into.

I'm really looking forward to getting into the city, where people do the sensible thing when it snows and don't drive for a week.
