[Go Blue! Volkswagen's Diesel-Sipping Polo Gets 72 mpg - Jalopnik](http://www.jalopnik.com/cars/alternative-energy/go-blue-volkswagens-dieselsipping-polo-gets-72-mpg-190474.php)

I don't know.  But I know I want my next car to run on biodiesel and need refueling once ever 4-6 weeks.  It's too bad the Polo has gotten away from the 1989 GTI "17 year old guys think this is cool" look and moved towards the "17 year old girls think this is cute" look.  Maybe if I get one in black and put flames on the side . . .
