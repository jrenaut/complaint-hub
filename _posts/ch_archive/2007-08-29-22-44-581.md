Everything is working.  My screen resolution is a lovely 1280X800, everything works, and I'm pretty friggin' happy.  Vista is still broken, but I haven't tried to fix it.

As promised, I have written up my [HowTo](?page_id=598).  Here I explain how I got [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) running on a [Lenovo](http://www.lenovo.com) Thinkpad T61.  It wasn't easy, but hopefully I can help make it a little easier for everyone else.

So, [click here](?page_id=598) to find out how I installed Ubuntu.
