Yesterday morning, it was 65 degrees (18 C for those of you who use that ridiculous system.  Freezing is zero degrees?  Crazy!) out when I went to work.  Today, it was 34 (1 C).

Now, I like the cold.  But those first few days of cold are always a bit of a shock.  All the windows in the house were still open this morning, so it was a bit chilly inside.  And our flag football game tomorrow is at 8AM, so that will probably be cold.

Of course, it's still hot in my office, as usual.

Anyway, that's probably all I have to say about the weather.
