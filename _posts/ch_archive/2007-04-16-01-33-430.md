[Secret Immigration Raids in the D.C. Subway - NAM](http://news.ncmonline.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=66e7a2a67f4329f98b24962b479a7668)

I may be a little unsure of what I think should be done about the immigration problems in this country, but picking out Latinos on the Metro and asking for "papers" is not the answer.  It's hard to fathom who might have thought that was a good idea.

I understand that many immigrants are coming in illegally, and many aren't paying taxes, but still benefit from American tax dollars.  And I understand that I'm not one of the citizens being noticeably hurt by the fact that they're here.  But whatever solution we come up with has to start with the fact that these are human beings, and this is the United States.  This is not a country where people of any color should have to worry about being stopped and asked for papers.

We need a solution.  We need to stop politicizing this, like we do everything else, and figure out what is best for the country, and what is best for people looking for better lives.  And then we have to implement that solution.
