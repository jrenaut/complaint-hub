The DMV tells me that it only takes 15 signatures to get a street zoned, so maybe it actually happened.  You'd think maybe they'd notify the residents.  But, the woman I spoke with couldn't tell me whether our street had actually been zoned, or if the signs were just wrong.  She transferred me to someone who could, but no one answered.  I have the number, though, so I'm going to call back.
