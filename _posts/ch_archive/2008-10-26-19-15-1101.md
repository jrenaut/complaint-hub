I thought this was idiotic when [Gizmodo]() mentioned it, but now [Slashdot](http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/10/26/1737229&from=rss) says that this is actually the US Army. This is terrifying. 

> A chapter titled 'Potential for Terrorist Use of Twitter' notes that Twitter members reported the July Los Angeles earthquake faster than news outlets and activists at the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis used it to provide information on police movements. 

Do you know what else is both ubiquitous and _super_ dangerous? AIR. It's highly flammable, and it's friggin' _everywhere_. I pray every day that no one tells the terrorists. And you know what else is really dangerous? WATER. It makes us _drown_. Think what could happen if Al Qaeda found that out. And the Earth is _over seventy percent water_. I hope Osama Bin Laden doesn't read my blog. You know why education and health care in this country is always short on money? It's because we pay people to conduct studies like this.
