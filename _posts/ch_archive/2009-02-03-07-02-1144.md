The scammy scammers from WikiMetro, who take money to put ads on sites that don't accept them, have contacted me again. See [here](/blog/is-wikimetro-a-scam) and [here](/blog/wikimetro-says-were-totally-not-a-scam) for my previous contact with them. 

> Hi Drupalcon, Thanks for the email. Let's schedule a time to talk on the telephone about this. Please go to http://list.wikimetro.org/contact.aspx Choose 'Phone' (it requires you to create a username) and choose a time for us to call you back. We've been a bit busy, but we can usually call you back in 10 minutes. Lisa Anderson Customer Service Wikimetro 

They called me "Drupalcon" again. I _know_ my custom site layout doesn't follow conventions (I didn't know this when I built it, and a redesign is in the works) so that automatic site parsers get confused. But starting a business relationship by scraping blogs for contact info is insane. I have never emailed them. And listing my blog on their site as "participating" is an outright lie, as well. Your blog may be listed on their site, too - you can [check here](http://list.wikimetro.org/market/?cat=blog&state=Wash_DC&city=Wash_DC) to see. Do _NOT_ pay them $25 to have ads appear on this site. If you really want to put ads here, I'm happy to talk, but I'm not sure my traffic is really worth your time. Anyway, I wasn't sure when they first contacted me, but there is no doubt in my mind that Wikimetro is a scam, and you should have nothing to do with them.
