I still have no response from them.  They didn't even respond to the online form, although I told them another letter was coming, so maybe they figured they'd wait for that.  I'm not sure they realize who they're dealing with.  Do they not know who I am?  They will taste the wrath of the Better Business Bureau before long, you wait and see.  They will rue the day they stole 16 hours of my bachelor party.
