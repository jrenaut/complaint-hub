Well, it wasn't really angry, exactly.  Puzzled is probably more accurate.  But it's [here](http://www.complainthub.com/?page_id=182), along with Safeway's response.  Well, along with a summary of Safeway's response, because their email to me had a "don't share this with anyone or we'll shoot you" note at the bottom.

_Note:  Safeway did not actually threaten to shoot me.  I just said that for effect. _
