Stupid Comcast. They fixed part of our cable and internet problems. They're claiming we have a weak signal. But our HD channels are coming in just fine. But we don't get Comedy Central and the stations that rerun Law and Order: SVU all day, which makes the wife a little salty. And our internet doesn't work at all. Which means I can't post the pictures of our progress this weekend to Flickr. So, let me just say that our hallway/art gallery is looking fantastic. And it only took four drill bits and countless trips to Home Depot. We melted a titanium drill bit. I don't know the <del>chemical properties</del> physical properties (Thanks, non-blogging-scientist-brother-in-law) of titanium, but you get the impression that it's pretty tough, right? And you figure that melting it would be hard? Turns out it's not as hard as you might think.

But it's all finished now. The wife was putting a final coat of paint on this morning, and we'll hang pictures tonight. Comcast is due back between 5-8PM to give it one more shot, so maybe I'll even be able to upload pictures. If I do, you'll get a sneak preview of the color we're going to paint our bedroom next time we get a weekend with a little free time. I really like the color.
