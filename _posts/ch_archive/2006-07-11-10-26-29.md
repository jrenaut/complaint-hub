Unfortunately, I can't really say why yet. I'm curious, though - in 64 pages, we've gone from the birth of her grandmother to Bill proposing - what the heck is she going to talk about for the next 450 pages? One thing I'm sure of, she'll mention wonderful people who've become lifelong friends. And she'll probably pat herself on the back for being so gosh darn eager to change the world through dialogue and diplomacy!
