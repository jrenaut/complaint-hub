[Sutori: Digg for Consumerists - Consumerist](http://consumerist.com/consumer/sutori/sutori-digg-for-consumerists-192705.php)

This site is more or less what I had in mind for Complaint Hub, except I would have skipped the meaningless Web 2.0 name.  Sutori?  WTF is that?  I guess if I want to compete, I'll have to hook up with the Better Business Bureau and allow people to complain to someone who really listens rather than just their fellow internet nerds.
