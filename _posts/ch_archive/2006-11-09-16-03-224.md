[Allen to Concede Election This Afternoon - washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/09/AR2006110900775.html?nav=rss_email/components)

> Virginia Sen. George Allen (R) will concede that he has lost the election to Democrat James Webb at a 3 p.m. news conference in Alexandria, according to a source close to the campaign with direct knowledge of the senator's intentions.

Now it's time for the Democrats to come through on all the stuff they promised.  I mean, they have a few weeks before they have to start campaigning for the 2008 Presidency, right?  Let's get some bipartisan compromising done!
