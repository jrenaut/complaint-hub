It's a little harder to rack up the word count when you're writing a screenplay instead of a novel.  But I've got 805 words in my inaugural [Script Frenzy](http://scriptfrenzy.org) effort, which is 138 more than my daily goal.  I still plan to do more writing tonight, because I expect to be busy all weekend, and I don't want to go into Monday too far behind.

I kind of like the screenplay format.  I'm using [Celtx](http://www.celtx.com/), which I really like.  I don't have anything to compare it to, so maybe it's really a piece of crap, but I like it.  I'd recommend it.  It's free, and it makes formatting a screenplay pretty easy.

I'm debating whether or not I want to share the screenplay here as I go.  Part of me wants to do it, and part of me is scared that people will read it and think that I'm crazy or something.

So I leave it to you, my loyal readers.  If I get three real, compelling reasons to post the screenplay as I write it, I'll do it.  One reason per reader.
