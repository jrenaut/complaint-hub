She'll think I'm crazy, but that's just because she's not as big of a nerd as I am. Anyway, you may notice that, when I talk about a baseball player, I usually link to his career stats at [Baseball Reference](http://www.baseball-reference.com). It's a great site for the stat nerd. And they support themselves through sponsorships. Yesterday, I decided to sponsor two pages in the name of Complaint Hub. The first is [Chad Bradford](http://www.baseball-reference.com/b/bradfch01.shtml), one of the stars of [Moneyball](http://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207586525&sr=8-1) and now an Oriole. As you can see from his stat page, Billy Beane and the A's got four years out of him for about what the Orioles are paying him this year. But that's okay. The second is [Mark Knudson](http://www.baseball-reference.com/k/knudsma01.shtml). When I was little, I had a little handheld baseball game, Tomy Pocket Baseball. You pulled the lever and a ball dropped, and then you released the lever to swing the bat and try to hit the ball into one of the holes for a hit. It was awesome. I had my own league. I used real players, their names painstakingly copied from baseball cards. Mark Knudson was the all-time leader in wins. He retired with a record of 48-5 and a 0.59 ARPI. I used Average Runs Per Inning because my games tended to be higher scoring than real baseball games, and not multiplying by the number of innings in a game made a good ARPI look more like a good ERA. These were four inning games, so his ERA would have been 2.37, which would have been fine. But he was the greatest of all-time, and the average pitcher would have had a much higher ERA. Anyway, I have no idea if these sponsorships will drive any traffic here. But I get a lot of enjoyment from Baseball Reference, and now I've given something back.
