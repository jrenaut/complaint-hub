Tony Romo [_still_ sucks in December](/blog/romo-still-sucks-december). he threw two interceptions and lost another fumble in the Cowboys [loss to the Ravens](http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/boxscore?game_id=29753&displayPage=tab_box_score&season=2008&week=REG16). The Cowboys can still make the playoffs, but they'll probably need some help, and they've given Philadelphia a chance not only to play for their own playoff spot, but a chance to play the Cowboys out of the playoffs. Philly is playing well since their tie with Cincinnati, and I wouldn't want to play them right now needing a win to advance. Romo's actually had a better December this year than in previous years - he did lead the Cowboys to 17 fourth quarter points with two touchdown passes. But it's just not enough, and it's not what he does every year before December. I wonder if there are other players who are so good for part of the year and so bad for the rest? By the way, no one will believe me now, and I should have had the courage to predict it, but I said to myself when I saw the Cowboys schedule that Ed Reed would have a big game for the Ravens. Next time I won't be such a coward.
