If you're a programmer, you've probably come across [Experts Exchange](http://www.experts-exchange.com) while searching for help on some programming problem. Today I was wondering if sqlldr could generate a table for you, or if you had to make the table, then run sqlldr. It's not important. Unless you know the answer. Anyway, the first result for whatever it was I searched for was from Experts Exchange. This sucks, because while they let you read the question, you have to pay (or start a free trial) for the answer. So they often come up on Google, but the question is never helpful. Yes, I could pay for the answer. I won't, but I could. What I'd really like to do is never get results from their site when I search. Can you do that with Google? You _should_ be able to.
