Via [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5048670/dropbox-leaves-private-beta-invite-no-longer-necessary), [DropBox](http://www.getdropbox.com) just came out of beta. Installing it gives you a folder on your hard drive that's synced to their server. Any file you drop in there is automatically synced to any other computer you have registered with the service. It's cross-platform - I have my work computer (running Windows XP) and my home computer (Ubuntu) connected, and file syncing between them seems to be flawless. There are tons of other ways to do this, but DropBox gives you two free gigs or lets you pay for more, and the interface is pretty sweet. In addition to the desktop folder, you can access your files from a web browser anywhere. It's really nice to see the level of Linux support they're offering. They're not supporting _all_ distributions, but how rare is it to see a service come right out of beta and already have a Linux version?
