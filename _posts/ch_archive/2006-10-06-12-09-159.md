_Gayle originally left this as a comment on [this post](http://www.complainthub.com/?p=163), but I have to share it on the main page._

this guy intrigues me. first, he obviously has a hair dryer at workâ€¦but no towel? i would think most guys would have a towel before a hair dryer. of course, iâ€™m a girl and i just blow dryed my hair for the first time in several years the other week (itâ€™s long hair, too).

second, he was drying his body with the dryer? as opposed to his hair or shirt?? i think itâ€™s safe to say thatâ€™s a little strange, even in the privacy of your own bathroom.

third, this post prompts me to share a related work bathroom etiquette complaint:

i work in a building with 2 womenâ€™s restrooms and maybe 6 women total. each bathroom is a single locking room (no multiple stalls, so one person at a time, technically). one of the women i work with is just coming off maternity leave and has to pump her breast milk every few hours. this takes up about half an hour of single bathroom time. i am completely on board and understanding of that.

the thing that bothers me is, another one of the women in my lab will come in, go into the only other bathroom (while the first is unavailable), and put on make up and do her hairâ€¦with a curling iron! this seems a little less pertinent to me than pumping breast milk, especially when i have to use the bathroom for more legitimate reasons. and to add insult to injury, this woman generally doesnâ€™t look any different after all of her primping.

as a result of this whole scenario, i can say iâ€™ve: a. been inconvenienced on more than one occasion, and b. been inside (and used) the menâ€™s room at my work.
