A woman in the hallway at work just told me I look like [Taylor](http://www.americanidol.com/contestants/season5/taylor_hicks/) from American Idol. I'm not sure I agree. Maybe it's just the grey hair.

I've heard more often that I look like [Claudio Reyna](http://www.ussoccer.com/bio/index.jsp_78461.html).

I think I'd rather look like Claudio Reyna.
