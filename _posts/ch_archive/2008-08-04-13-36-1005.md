Have you ever posted to an internet forum or commented on a blog post and began with, "Oddly enough"? If the answer is yes, then I don't like you very much. Has anyone ever followed "Oddly enough" with something _really_ odd? Not in my experience. It's pretty meaningless. If what you're saying really is odd, we'll know. Are you trying to forewarn us of the oddity so we don't think you're weird for saying something odd out of the blue without acknowledging it? That is, are you embarrassed to be thought strange by people you don't know? I realize now that the likelihood of [someone](http://www.marketingfinanceobama.com/) commenting on this post and beginning with "oddly enough" is now near 100%. Just remember that I have admin rights on all the comments.
