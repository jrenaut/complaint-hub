The [busted foot](/blog/foot-surgery-awesome) is not feeling too great today. I've been icing it, and moving my ankle around to keep the blood flowing, but it's still bothering me. So, I figured I'd try out the Tylenol 3 that they prescribed for me. I finished the work I really needed to get done this week, had some lunch, and took two of them. Well, that was disappointing. Friends had assured me that Tylenol 3 was pretty good stuff - it would definitely take care of my foot. Unfortunately, they were lying. I think it made me a little drowsy, but it sure didn't help my foot much. The only thing that really seems to help is icing it, and that's only for twenty minutes at a time. So, I'm left here to complain about it. Fortunately I have lots of practice.
