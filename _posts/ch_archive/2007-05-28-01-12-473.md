It turns out it was kind of silly for me to manage two blogs.  I mean, who needs two blogs?  So I'm combining them.  If you're a regular reader of this blog and [From Harvard Street](http://columbiaheights.complainthub.com), you'll see some posts you may have read there show up here.  They should all be [here](http://www.blog.complainthub.com/?cat=77), in fact.

All the comments from Harvard Street have not been transferred over.  They aren't gone, though, and I may eventually transfer them.  If I get really motivated, I might even redirect the permalinks to Harvard Street posts so that they go to the corresponding Complaint Hub posts.

Anyway, if you have any questions, just ask.
