On my way to work today, I was behind a girl about my age driving a little Corolla.  I happened to look down at her license plate.  It said "4 RIZZL".  It was a Jimmy Buffett "Parrothead" plate.  Yes, Virginia offers a Parrothead license plate.  It was in a license plate frame with dolphins on it.

I think I'll stop now, because there is nothing I can say to make this any funnier.
