First webmail, now [Del.icio.us](http://delicious.com/). Actually, Delicious went first. The [webmail ban](/blog/webmail-isnt-evil-it-departments-are) isn't supposed to go in for another week. Why is this annoying? Because I bookmark _work-related sites_ through Delicious. Sure, that's not all I use it for. But a big chunk of my bookmarks there are reference for work. And now I can't get to them. And I'm not saying they don't have the right to block what they want, because it's their network, and they can block all IP addresses divisible by 17 if they want. I'm just saying it's stupid, it makes me less effective, and it annoys me to no end.
