I keep seeing articles about how this week is supposed to be really bad for traffic because everyone is back to work after various summer vacations.  Yesterday (Tuesday) was supposed to be the worst.

But I'm not seeing it.  In fact, today was one of the least crowded days on the Metro that I've seen in a while.  I actually had a seat to myself from Mount Vernon Square all the way to Pentagon City on the Yellow line, which almost never happens.

I don't know if car traffic is worse - I haven't driven anywhere since Sunday, and I don't think that counts.  For those of you poor saps who drive to work in the DC Metro area - has it been bad this week?
