If you're like me (That is, a rational human being not raised in New York), you hate the New York Yankees. You're probably jealous of the cretins who actually root for them because they've averaged a World Series win every 4 years or so since 1900. It's nice to root for a winner.

Anyway, tonight, you can safely root for the Yankees. Since 2000, which is as far as I've gone back, the Yankees are 0-3 in three game playoff series when they win the first game, and 4-0 when they lose.

In contrast, in all other three game playoff series, the team that wins game one is 16-5 in winning the series.

So, for you Phillies, Angels, and Cubs fans - you've got a tough road ahead of you.  But for you Indians fans, volunteer to pitch tonight to ensure a Yankees series loss.  The rest of the country will thank you for it.
