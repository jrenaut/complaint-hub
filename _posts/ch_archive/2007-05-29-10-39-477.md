[Sabermetric Research: The large supply of tall people](http://sabermetricresearch.blogspot.com/2007/05/large-supply-of-tall-people.html)

> But there's a short supply of humans who are in the right tail of any and every normal distribution. Again, why should height be different? I see three ways height is different, and both of them work *against* Berri's argument.

I've been reading the above blog ever since I came across it on the [Numbers Guy](http://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/) blog at the WSJ.  This morning, I realized why I like it so much.  This guy takes two things I love, justice and files . . . I mean, statistics and complaining, and sticks them together.  He reads something, like a person blaming the competitive imbalance in basketball on the small supply of tall people, and he not only says, "Hey, you're wrong" (Which I love to do), but then he goes on to give statistical analysis on WHY (Which I would do if I were a little more educated and motivated).

His analysis is pretty accessible, and it's usually (Almost always, I guess) sports-related.

Anyway, I recommend the blog.  If you've ever listened to an argument and thought, "Hey, you're wrong, but I can't show you why", you'll enjoy reading.
