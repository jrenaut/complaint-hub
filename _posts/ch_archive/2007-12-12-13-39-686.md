> We’re still waiting on a response for the big ticket, the $100 ticket. The wife wrote that letter. She’s a lawyer, so she should be better at convincing them, but we had a much stronger case on the one that I contested. So we’ll see.

Yes, I just quoted myself. Shut up. A couple of days ago, we finally got the letter saying that they forgave the big ticket, too. We weren't sure what was going to happen - the car still had the old Virginia tags then. I'm sure if they tried they could get my SSN or VIN or something from Virginia and track down my DC registration that way, but that involves WORK, and I just wasn't sure they were actually going to do that. But I didn't want to contact the DMV after it was taking them forever to get back to us on this ticket, because that would absolve them of doing any work to connect me to the old ticket. Anyway, it's moot now, because they finally succumbed to my wife's crushing grip of reason and tore up the ticket. That brings our record on contesting tickets to 4-0, I think.
