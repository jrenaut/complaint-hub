[ 'Diet' foods weight gain puzzle](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7233459.stm)

>  Scientists from Purdue University in the US now believe that a sweet taste followed by no calories may make the body crave extra food.

So, instead of being better for you, artificial sweeteners give you cancer, [metabolic syndrome](?p=755), and make you fatter.   Artificial sweeteners are not actually food.  They are chemicals that trick you into tasting "sweet".  Every study I've ever seen says they're bad for you.

So, stop eating them.  Just eat less sweets.  You don't need that diet soda.  You don't need the little blue and pink packets of powdered crap in your coffee.

I've found, as I've cut down on drinking soda, that I don't enjoy it as much as I used to.  I used to LOVE Coke.  Given a choice, I would almost always drink that.  Then I found beer, and that took away the top spot, but Coke was always my top non-alcoholic drink.

I still drink it sometimes - I don't believe in cutting things that I enjoy out of my life completely just because they aren't good for me.  If I generally eat healthfully, then one bacon cheeseburger with fries and a large Coke every once in a while isn't going to kill me.

In any event, **you** should stop consuming artificial sweeteners.
