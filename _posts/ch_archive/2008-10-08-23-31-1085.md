I did sign up for Twitter. You can see it to the right if you're actually at the site and not reading the RSS. I also signed up at [IMified](http://www.imified.com) so I could "tweet" through Google Talk. I still don't really see the appeal, but I haven't given it much of a chance. We'll see what happens.
