Have you ever been driving down 17th Street NW, getting ready to turn right on E to head out to Virginia, when some guy in an ill-fitting suit talking on his cell phone jogs across the street against the light? Have you ever given him a look and thrown up your hands in frustration? Has he ever had the audacity to flip you off in return? This didn't happen to me this afternoon just after five, in case you're wondering. I pride myself on paying attention to pedestrians and right-of-way. I know, what do I want, a cookie? But really, many, many people in this city, especially Maryland drivers (You know who you are) pretend that pedestrians don't exist, and crosswalks are merely warnings before stop signs or red lights to run. So when I'm treated like this by pedestrians who think they are much, much more important than they really are, it bothers me. When you have the right of way, I'll gladly wait. But when I have the right of way, I expect you to be on the sidewalk where you belong.
