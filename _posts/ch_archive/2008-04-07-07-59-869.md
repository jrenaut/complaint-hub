This is posted in category "work", but it really should be posted in "the utter lack of anything resembling work", because I am totally free this week. Friday was my last day at my old job, and I don't start the new one until a week from today. So here I am, wide awake at 7:53AM. Some vacation, you say. Well, it is. I'm up now by choice. First, I rarely sleep in anymore, so if I lay in bed until what most would consider a reasonable hour, it would throw off my whole day. Second, I have things to do. I have a novel burning a hole in my head that needs to come out. I've planned this one more than anything else I've ever written (Although still way less than anyone who writes for a living would have), and I want to get started. [Novel Writing Month](http://www.nanowrimo.org) isn't getting me any closer to having a novel fit for sending off in search of a publisher, so I'm trying a different technique. So I'm going to start writing as soon as wife gets off to work and out of my hair. Then, later, I have to take the cat to the vet. Then we're going to check out some day care centers this afternoon, and we have tickets to the Nationals game tonight (Assuming it's actually done raining). Anyway, big day. And I see my coffee is finished brewing, and the wife is heading out the door, so I'm going to get started on my vacation. Sorry to all of you who have to work today.
