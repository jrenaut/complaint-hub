[NYTimes.com | Griping Online? Comcast Hears and Talks Back](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/technology/25comcast.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin)

> From a sparse desk dominated by two computer screens in the new Comcast Center here, Mr. Eliason uses readily available online tools to monitor public comments on blogs, message boards and social networks for any mention of Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company. When he sees a complaint like Mr. Dilbeck’s, he contacts the source to try to defuse the problem.

A friend pointed out this article, which describes a blogger complaining about Comcast, and getting contacted by a "digital care manager" from Comcast, who helped him with his problem. I bitch about Comcast [ALL THE TIME](http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Awww.complainthub.com+comcast). Where's my digital care manager? This is a load of crap. I'm angry with Comcast pretty much every time I turn on my tv, and especially when I get my monthly bill. Or when our tv and internet was out for three weeks, and the techs kept either being unable to fix the problem or leaving their equipment in our living room. But I get nothing. Thanks a lot, Comcast. As an aside, the fact that the NYTimes mentions the guy's blog by name but doesn't bother to link to it is complete and utter horsecrap. It's incredibly rude. Not that it's hard to find [Brandon Notices](http://brandonnotices.blogspot.com/) via Google, but I shouldn't have to do that.
