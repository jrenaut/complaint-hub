[This Is Broken - Warning on Hasbro pony toy](http://www.thisisbroken.com/b/2006/11/furreal_friends.html)

> "Adults take note: Pony comes unassembled in box with head detatched. You may wish to not open the box around your children if they may be frightened by a box with a decapitated horse inside."

I guess it's nice to warn parents that their children may be scarred for life when they open the box and see that their wonderful new pony is headless.  Although, I'm not sure it's really the box that's frightening.  I mean, if you are frightened by a headless pony, I don't think the placement of the pony inside or outside of a box will make much difference.
