&nbsp_place_holder;West Virginia symbolizes everything that is wrong with college football.&nbsp_place_holder; They are playing flag football and winning against legitimate football programs.&nbsp_place_holder; The worst thing that could happen for the BCS would be if West Virginia played any Mike Leach coached team in a bowl game.

&nbsp_place_holder;I will literally cry if WVU wins a national championship, and subsequently earns Pat White a Heisman.&nbsp_place_holder; I've never been a bigger Pitt Panthers fan in my life.

And...the Big East is a joke.&nbsp_place_holder; Their automatic bid to the BCS should be stripped for lack of quality teams.&nbsp_place_holder;
