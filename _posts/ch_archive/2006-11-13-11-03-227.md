With Novel Writing Month (a personal daily best of 5700 words on Friday), preparing to deliver version 3.0 at work, getting the condo ready to sell, and various other life responsibilities, I feel like I'm not complaining enough.  At least, not here.  I'm certain I've done enough complaining about painting, even though my wife does most of the work.

So, I'd like to apologize to my loyal fans.  This week is pretty busy, but next week is looking a little better, and the week after that even better.  I could be wrong, though.  But I'll be back to my normal elevated level of complaining as soon as possible.
