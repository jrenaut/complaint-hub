On [October 13](http://www.complainthub.com/?p=175), I posted about a new soft drink called Enviga, and how I didn't believe the marketing hype. On [October 18th](http://www.complainthub.com/?p=185), I posted again about Enviga and how it sucks. On October 19th, I got an email from a guy who works for [Manning Selvage & Lee](http://www.mslpr.com), an advertising firm representing Coca Cola. 

> Hello, My name is Craig Eldon and I'm assisting in the launch of Coke's new sparkling green tea - Enviga.
> 
> I've read your blog and thought detailed news about this new product might be a fit for your readers. I have pre-sale samples available for you and would like to provide detailed information about this new drink category.
> 
> What do you think? I look forward to hearing from you shortly.

> Best, Craig

Today, I received three cans of not-yet-released-to-the-public "sparkling green tea", Enviga. Coke calls it "The Calorie Burner". Later tonight, the wife and I are going to try it. On Monday (Because no one reads blogs on the weekend), you'll have a full report on the aspartame-filled beverage.

It's interesting - I exchanged a few emails with Craig, and every subsequent email had a note at the bottom threatening all that I hold dear if I shared any information. I'm actually not going to share any of it with you. The reason for this is that they obviously thought about what communication they could and couldn't keep privilaged. That is, they knew an unsolicited marketing email could hardly be called private, but once I responded, they had some reasonable expectation for my discretion. The fact that they made this distinction suggests that they are on firm legal ground in restricting what I can and can't share, so I'm going to listen to them.

I will have you know that I have received only a few emails, some marketing documents, and three cans of Enviga from Craig. There is no money, nor promise of money, nor any other sort of compensation. The review of Enviga you read here on Monday will be honest, and it will be my opinion, whatever that turns out to be.

I hope you're excited.Â  I know I sure am.
