[![Golfing Benjamin](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/136/335797295_09f7094218_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/335797295/) While I was at my father-in-law's over Christmas, I got a chance to hang out with my new nephews (New to me - they're the sons of my brother- and sister-in-law). The older one, not pictured here, I'd met before. Benjamin, above, I'd met before, but he's still pretty young. This is the first time I've hung out with him since he could really communicate. Two days ago, he was asking to play golf. There's a nerf golf set in the basement, and the kids like to go down and play, but Benjamin is a little small to do it himself. I happened to walk by the kitchen as people were cooking dinner and Benjamin was looking for an escort into the basement. My wife told him to ask me, since I wasn't busy cooking. So he did, and he and I went downstairs. He carefully set up all the little plastic holes. I put the flags on the sticks for him, and he put them in the slots where they belong. Then he hit the ball around a bit (His short game needs work, but he's got the "put the ball in the hole" part down). Then he looked at me and said, "All done."

And then, to my amazement, he started putting everything away. He gathered the holes (I had to help him remove the flags) and put everything back in the box. I only prompted him for one or two pieces that he forgot, and only after he had started cleaning on his own. When everything was put away, he said, "Go see mommy." And we went back upstairs.

Watching little kids like that has always fascinated me.  I wonder about the thought process that goes on in his head.  Sometimes I think they couldn't possibly be comprehending what it seems like they are.

I guess it's good practice for when I have my own kids.
