Seriously. I finally made it to Yankee Stadium. And I was rewarded for my troubles (Well, the wife's troubles. Thanks, wife!) with [a horrible Orioles loss](http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=280730110). [Sarfate](http://www.baseball-reference.com/s/sarfade01.shtml) managed only 4 innings, walking three and allowing five runs, although only three earned. [Burres](http://www.baseball-reference.com/b/burrebr01.shtml) and [Cabrera](http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/cabrefe01.shtml) were even worse. On the bright side, I did see a [future Hall of Famer](http://www.baseball-reference.com/r/rodrial01.shtml) hit a home run in one of the most hallowed places in baseball. And we had a nice lunch with a friend and a nice dinner with a brother-in-law. I was impressed with the Yankees fans. They were much more pleasant on their home turf than they are in Baltimore. There were a few words exchanged between Yankee and Oriole fans, but nothing nasty. And the Orioles fans actually came out in pretty good numbers. The guy next to me was part of a group of about 400 O's fans from Pennsylvania who came up for the game. The new Yankee stadium across the street is UGLY. I mean, hideous. I didn't get a good look at it, and the inside is probably nicer, but the outside looks like a giant bank. Next on my list of stadiums to visit is Wrigley Field. Probably not this year, though.
