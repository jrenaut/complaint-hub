[![Blue Complaint Hub Shirt](/files/blue_shirt.jpg)](http://www.cafepress.com/complainthub)

You may have noticed a new section in the right sidebar - Merchandise! Inspired by a [friend](http://www.marketingfinanceobama.com/), I have made Complaint Hub t-shirts! And you can buy them! And, just in case the sheer awesomeness of the shirt isn't motivation enough to buy one, the first person I see wearing one who I don't know in person at the time of seeing the shirt will be entitled to a beer at [CommonWealth](http://www.commonwealthgastropub.com/) on me. Or, something of more or less equivalent value if you happen to not drink beer for whatever reason. So, current friends and family are not eligible for this offer. But all of you locals reading the site hoping I'll go off on another rant about DC parking enforcement are! If you have ideas for how I could make the shirt better, feel free to share. A graphic designer I most certainly am not.
