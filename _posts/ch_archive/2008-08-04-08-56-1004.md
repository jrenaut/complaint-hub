[PoP Exclusive: First Look Inside the New Restaurant CommonWealth Opening Aug. 6th](http://www.princeofpetworth.com/?p=3452)

> Even with all the craziness it had a very warm and open feel. I was excited to see checkers and chess tables, an open bar area and some very comfortable seats. I am super stoked to try the place.

I hate it when restaurants don't update their [website](http://commonwealthgastropub.com/). But I guess I'll forgive them if the place ends up being as cool as people say it will be. I haven't been past it yet - with the bum foot and pregnant wife, I haven't been doing as much walking around as I might otherwise. But PoP's pictures of the place look great, and [this thread at realbeer.com](http://www.realbeer.com/discussions/showthread.php?p=220650) suggests the beer selection will be good. This is also a great option for me next time I work from home and the wife admonishes me, "No PotBelly or Five Guys for lunch today!". Although I don't suppose obeying the letter and ignoring the spirit will win me many brownie points.
