[![Pictures](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2235/1681576351_67e2f7f493_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/1681576351/)We finally got some pictures hung.  It was a huge pain in the neck.  Have you ever used a hammer drill?  If not, don't.  It taps as it spins the drill bit, and it makes the most awful noise.  It makes a nice hole in the cement, though, so that was good.  We picked up a roll of aluminum flashing, which they use for something or other.  Then we got a cheap piece of molding, painted it, and screwed them both into the wall.  I even made an attempt to countersink the screws, and it almost worked.

Anyway, it looks pretty hot.  And now that we know we can do it, we'll go back and get some more wood and hang some more pictures.

By the way, the photo on the left was taken by the wife on the honeymoon in Melbourne, and the one on the right I took in photography class in college.
