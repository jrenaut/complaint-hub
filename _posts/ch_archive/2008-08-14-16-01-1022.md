I was just reminded of [Brad Ziegler](http://www.baseball-reference.com/z/zieglbr01.shtml) by a post at [It Is About the Money](http://itsaboutthemoney.blogspot.com/2008/08/against-all-odds.html), which is a Yankees blog but not obnoxiously so. Anyway, Ziegler still hasn't ever given up a run in the major leagues. 29 games, 38 innings, zero runs. He broke a [100 year old record](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/mariners/2008076679_albeat28.html) for scoreless innings to start a career 13 innings ago. But you barely hear anything about him. I haven't seen him on the front page of ESPN at all. I know Oakland isn't New York or Boston, but if this guy played for the Yankees or Red Sox, he would be on SportsCenter every 34 seconds. I wonder how many innings he has to pitch without giving up a run to get some attention? Maybe after the Olympics are over. Edit to add: It was less than three hours from the time this post went up until his streak ended. I feel like I jinxed it. That sucks.
