Since I can't get it out of my head after inexplicably hearing it coming out of a car window on 16th Street this morning, I'd like to get [The Freshman](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2474) by The Verve Pipe into your head, too. That link up there? It's the first hit for 'annoying song freshmen', although Google thinks I meant "freshman". I guess I sort of did, but isn't the word plural in the chorus? Sing it to yourself, you'll remember. And now you feel my pain.
