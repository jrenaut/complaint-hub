I admit that this is a minor and easily fixable gripe, but the built in spell-check dictionary for Firefox 2.0 does not include the word "okay" or "ok" by default.  Is there some fight about whether or not this is a word?  I thought it was universally accepted as part of the English language.  It's pretty easy to add it, and then it's not a problem again, but it seems strange that it's not included.

Other than that, 2.0 is pretty cool.  Memory footprint is still too big, but I like the new features.  It does break the "Alt-a" add a link in the WordPress dashboard, which is annoying but not that big a deal.
