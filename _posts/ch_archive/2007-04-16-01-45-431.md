Okay, this is a cool idea. A new t-shirt every day, and the more people who buy it, the cheaper it gets.

But they don't have an RSS feed for the shirts. This is the type of site that RSS was made for. If I wasn't on my way to bed, I would email them right now and demand an RSS feed.

I mean, the nerve. Making me actually, like, check back every day to see what's new. I don't have time for that. Do you think these complaints write themselves?
