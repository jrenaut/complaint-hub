I just installed the latest version of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) 8.10 Intrepid Ibex. I totally botched my partitioning - I meant to install to a 20 GB partition with another 20 GB partition available for installing other Linux distributions (I'm going to start with [OpenSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org)) just for fun, and then use whatever's leftover for shared files. I also want to clean out the old version of Ubuntu, since I won't be using it again. It looks like I did neither of those, so I'm going to have to try again. However, on booting up Intrepid Ibex for the first time, I noticed the Bluetooth icon. The last version of Ubuntu didn't recognize the Bluetooth adapter in my laptop. It took me less than 30 seconds to hook up my laptop to my cell phone, something that I spent an hour trying to do on Windows XP and never really got to work properly. The process on Ubuntu was flawless and simple. Nice job, Ubuntu. Anyway, I'm off to try again. Or maybe I'm off to bed and will try again in the morning.
