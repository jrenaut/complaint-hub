I got a link from a new complaint blog this afternoon, and I thought I'd return the favor.  Apparently there's a whole complaint blog community out there that I haven't made myself a part of.  I may have to change that.

Now, do I post this tagged with a "complaint" category because it's on the subject of complaining, even though it isn't really a complaint?  I think I will.
