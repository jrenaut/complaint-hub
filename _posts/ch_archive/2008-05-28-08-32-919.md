Ethan Kaplan, the VP of technology at Warner Bros. Records, just [announced](http://blackrimglasses.com/archives/2008/05/27/mission-metallica/) a [new website](http://www.missionmetallica.com/) for Metallica that makes it look like they've finally decided that music plus internet is not necessarily bad. The site looks like it's trying to build a community of fans by giving them some free stuff, deals on merchandise, and promoting the new album. It's too bad I'm not still fourteen and eager to buy anything Metallica produced. It's funny that the crotchety old guys who wanted to kill the entire internet when people first realized they could download music illegally are now near the front of the pack of major (Okay, it's questionable if Metallica counts as "major" these days, but bear with me) bands embracing a "I can make more money by giving away non-scarce goods to promote the scarce ones" business model.
