I hate my laptop.  It's a Dell, and I have a Dell desktop that I've had since 1998 that I love.  Once it got too old to do much with, I installed Ubuntu Linux on it, and that's been pretty cool.  But this laptop has been a piece of crap ever since I bought it.  And now I've found that maybe I've put too much blame on Dell, and not nearly enough on Norton.  My antivirus that came with the computer expired long ago, and I refuse to pay for virus protection.  I've never had a virus in my life.  Never.  And I don't trust Norton to work, anyway.

So, the computer has been running slowly for a while.  Finally I decided to uninstall all the extra junk I've gathered along the way.  Soon enough, I got to Norton.  I can't believe how much faster the computer is running now that Norton is gone.  It's not just Norton, but that was the only thing I uninstalled where I saw an immediate change in how the computer was running.

I would suggest to all of you that you get rid of Norton, but I don't know what you should replace it with.  So I won't recommend that you do that just yet.  It's one thing for me to go without virus protection, but I'm not going to recommend that you do it.

But I have to say that I'm thrilled with my uninstalling exploits.  I'll keep you all posted on how it works from here on out.
