[Techdirt | Yahoo Offers Refunds Or DRM-Free Music In Exchange For Shutting Down DRM Servers](http://techdirt.com/articles/20080728/1455551813.shtml) Looks like Yahoo is going to make things right for customers who bought DRM'ed music at their old store. They'll either replace the music with DRM-free editions, or give refunds. Unlike Microsoft's band-aid (Keeping the DRM servers up for a few more years), this is an actual solution, righting the wrong that Yahoo did to its customers by "selling" them music that could be taken back at any time.
