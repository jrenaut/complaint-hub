So, I'm getting married the day after tomorrow.  As a result, I will be away from a computer until September 7th or so.   Which means that you'll have to look elsewhere for your complaining needs.   But, rest assured that I will be thinking about each and every one of you, Loyal Readers, the whole time I'm on my honeymoon.  Seriously.

And I'll be back.  But not until next month.  Try not to miss me too much.
