This entire book is a string of little chronological factoids about Bill and Hillary and the various wonderful people they have as good friends, and the various Republicans they strongly disagree with, but respect very much.

It has given me no reason to like or dislike Hillary.  I wish she'd give just some small insight into why she thinks the things she does.  Oh, well.  I didn't expect anything controversial.  I just maybe hoped for a little something interesting.

I'm not giving up yet.  I don't plan to give up at all.  But it sure is slow going.
