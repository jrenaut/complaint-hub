First, let me say it is truly a joy to pay a ticket at the DC DMV website. Of all the things the DC government does, <del>extorting</del> collecting money through the DMV website is something it actually gets right. I got a speed camera ticket on Michigan Avenue near Catholic University a few weeks ago. There were all of two cars on the road, and I was doing 37 in a 25. It's pretty annoying, because I really don't speed much these days. It's a $50 fine and no points, so I guess it isn't too terrible in the grand scheme of things. It just bugs me because I'm mostly a law-abiding (though aggressive) driver. Every day, I see people doing things in a car that are unsafe and illegal with no consequences, and I get a ticket for speeding on an empty road. What about the cabbie who zipped around me to run the red light at 15th and Mass NW yesterday? Or the four cars that turned right on H from the middle lane of 18th because they didn't feel like waiting in line? Anyway, I hope you enjoy my $50, DC. I hope it makes you very happy.
