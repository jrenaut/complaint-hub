[CNN.com - Bush heralds improved deficit figures - Jul 11, 2006](http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/07/11/budget.deficit.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories)

Bush says: 

> These tax cuts left nearly $1.1 trillion in the hands of American workers and families and small business owners. And they used this money to help fuel an economic resurgence [leading to higher tax revenues and a smaller deficit]

The AP says: 

> Impressive profits and big income gains by the wealthy are largely responsible for the surge in [tax] revenues and, in turn, the deficit drop.

Does the AP mean to point out the half-truth here, or are they honestly just trying to add some analysis?  I have to think the former, because I can't imagine that the AP would be that clueless.  But I don't really know for sure.
