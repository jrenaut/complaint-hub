Okay, snow I can deal with. That doesn't scare me. You have to drive more slowly, and leave more distance between you and the guy in front of you. It can be nerve-wracking, but it's not that big a deal.

But now they're calling for half an inch of ice by tomorrow, and that's where I have to draw the line. Ice is NOT COOL. Half an inch of ice on the ground means you should be curled up on the couch with a nice blanket and your significant other, and not out on the road. After all, it will be Valentine's Day. 

I have to talk to my team lead and see if there's anything constructive I can do from home tomorrow.
