[![DSC_8698](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2235/2419352265_efb022ebc1_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/2419352265/)So the Pope is in town. Since I work almost right next door to the White House, which is where he was hanging out this morning, some coworkers and I went up to the roof of the building to watch as he hopped into the PopeMobile and drove off down Pennsylvania Avenue and past the adoring throngs. Anyway, there are more pictures [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/sets/72157604576480602/). The view from the roof is pretty good. And there are electrical outlets and benches up there. With the weather getting nice, I might just have to take a laptop up there now and then.
