Ever since I [posted about him](/blog/thats-two-doubles-year), [Brandon Fahey](http://www.baseball-reference.com/f/faheybr01.shtml) is hitting up a storm. Including that game, he's .294/.294/.529 with a triple and three doubles. He's hit into two double plays, but maybe they weren't his fault. I mean, if there weren't other jerks on first, clogging up the basepaths, he'd just be grounding out.
