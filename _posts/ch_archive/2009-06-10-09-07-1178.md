The concert was, and I don't hesitate to use this word, _amazing_. The openers, [Street Sweeper Social Club](http://streetsweepersocialclub.com/), featuring Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine, were cool. They put on a good show. If I still ever listened to music, I would think about buying their new album next week. We did not stay for Jane's Addiction, so I can't say anything about them. When we arrived, having bought presale tickets through [NIN.com](http://www.nin.com), we found that not only were we not on the grass, but we were actually on the floor, right in front of the stage. Now, my friend and I are not really the type (Or the age, I guess) to crowd up front, but I could have held a conversation with Trent at a more or less normal volume from the distance we were away. Not with the crowd there, sure, but that's an idea of the how close we were. By the way, note to other bands - this is how to treat your fans. Presale tickets just required that you sign up at the website. When we arrived, there was a longish line to get in, and a short line to get presale tickets at will-call. I handed them my id, they gave me my tickets. They had my name printed on them. We went straight over to the presale entrance line, where they checked id again. So we couldn't possibly have scalped them, even if we had wanted to, and we barely had to stand in line. Plus we got awesome seats. Do you notice how this makes you money, makes your fans happy, and works perfectly with or without the horrors of music piracy? And then Nine Inch Nails came on. This is a text I sent the wife: 

> This is [expletive deleted] awesome. I'm getting goosebumps every time they start a new song

They played a great variety of stuff. They played the song from The Crow soundtrack, which was surprising. They played "Gave Up", one of my favorite not-as-well-known songs off 1992's Broken. They closed with "Head Like A Hole" and encored with "Hurt", much to the delight of the crowd. For most of the concert, I was just standing there, thinking, "I can't believe I'm here listening to Nine Inch Nails live". I'm looking forward to telling the kid someday how I left her with the wife to go see them. "Dad, you're old", she'll probably say. But that's okay.
