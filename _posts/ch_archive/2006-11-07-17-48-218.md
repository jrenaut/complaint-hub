[Polling places turn to paper ballots after glitches - CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/07/voting.problems.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories)

> "We got five machines -- one of them's got to work," said Willette Scullank, a troubleshooter from the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, elections board.

Looks like there was some difficulty voting in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and, shocker, Florida.  Some poll workers didn't know how to use the machines.  Now, I could be way off on this, but I'm pretty sure this wasn't a surprise election.  Shouldn't someone have checked that the machines worked, and that people knew how to use them?

Tomorrow, the Republicans will probably be blamed.  However, as whoever it was said (Google is not cooperating on this one), "Never ascribe to malice that which can be explained by incompetence".  I don't think there's any big conspiracy.  I have nothing to base that assumption on, but this is a blog, I don't have to have a basis for my sweeping judgments.
