Up until this afternoon, it could have been argued that I lived in a dentist's office. The front yard, such as it is, was clearly designed by someone who didn't want to offend anyone. Unfortunately for him, I was offended. What are those grass-bush-things? They're _ugly_. Especially after they got a little brown over the winter, and then they started growing again this spring. They looked terrible. I've been saying I wanted to replace them with something else pretty much since we moved in over two years ago. Today, I put my sweat where my mouth is. The wife, the kid, and I went to [Garden District](http://www.gardendistrict-dc.com/) and got plants and mulch and a little spade. They were quite helpful there.

We picked out a rose bush, some blue flowers, another bush that should flower late in the summer, and some marigolds. I don't remember all the details, but I know I had a marigold garden when I was about four years old. I'm sure I did most of the upkeep work. In my opinion, clearly unbiased, it looks amazing. We'll have to wait and see if anyone else in the building acknowledges my genius. One already told me it looked good, but he ran into me while I was cleaning up, so he pretty much had to say nice things. It remains to be seen if anyone else will do it unprompted. Luckily for me, a much improved garden is its own reward.
