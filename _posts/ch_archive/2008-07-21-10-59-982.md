I just saw the doctor this morning about my foot. He says it's healing nicely, and I got a less bulky bandage that makes it a little easier to walk. He also told me that I should be able to start running again in about six weeks. So, to celebrate my return, I'm going to do the [Boo! Run for Life](http://www.boorunforlife.com/about.html) on October 12th, a 10K to benefit the [Dean R. O'Neill Renal Cell Cancer Research Fund](http://www.renalcellcancer.org/). It should be fun. West Potomac Park is a nice, easy 10K course. It's flat and there's plenty of room. And it will be good motivation to get me running again.
