[Vonage shakeup: CEO resigns, cost-cutting announced](http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/12/vonage-shakeup-ceo-resigns-cost-cutting-announced/)

Things are not looking good for my VOIP-provider of choice.  I suppose I don't blame Verizon for suing Vonage instead of attempting to compete, since certainly they have a clear financial incentive to see Vonage go away.  But it's still a crappy thing to do.

And losing a CEO is usually not a sign of positive things to come.  Sure, maybe they'll find someone else to take them through this.  But when you lose the CEO because he just left, rather than you taking a proactive step of replacing him, that's less "shakeup" and more "rats from a sinking ship".

Looks like I will soon have to find a new VOIP provider.  It will not be Verizon.
