[Salsa Walnut Meat recipe at Gone Raw](http://goneraw.com/recipes/667-Salsa-Walnut-Meat)

When served on a (non-raw, non-vegan) organic whole wheat tortilla, this "taco meat" is fantastic.  I figured it would be edible, but this was way beyond edible.  This was good enough to request again.

I'd like to find a substitute for the walnuts so my mom can try it.  No matter how good it is, her walnut allergies would probably prevent her from enjoying it.
