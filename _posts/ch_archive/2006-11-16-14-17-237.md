[Harvey Manning, 1925-2006: Author of hiking guides 'was a force of nature'](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/292252_manning14.html)

> Helen Cherullo, publisher of The Mountaineers Books, recalled getting an early e-mail from him. It started, in all caps, "WHY I AM PISSED OFF ... ."

I'm not a hiker, although I do enjoy a bit of hiking on occasion.  One of Harvey Manning's daughters is one of my [Nano](http://www.nanowrimo.org) mentees.  From this article, he sounds like a cool guy.  One of the early environmentalists, he did a lot to protect the woods he loved to walk in. 

> Most of Manning's writings were done on a typewriter, and always on recycled paper -- usually with something else printed on the back, Cherullo said.

That's great, the idea of sending a manuscript to your publisher, typed up on the back of your grocery list or a note to your family.  I imagine many publishers would flip out, but I guess his was a little more tolerant.
