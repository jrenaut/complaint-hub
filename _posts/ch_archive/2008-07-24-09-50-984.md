Went to the DC United game last night. We didn't stick around for the three hour rain delay. This was the third time they tried to play this game (Although the first time I had tickets). We had pretty awesome seats thanks to a friend, and access to free food and drinks thanks to VW (through the same friend through another friend), and I managed to get home without getting my foot wet, per doctor's orders. I've been to a couple of DC United games this season, and it's becoming increasingly clear that the team doesn't much like to play defense. They just don't seem to have their hearts in it. Which is too bad, because the team doesn't seem half bad, and the defensive problems really look like they're due to a lack of effort more than a lack of skill. I won't claim to be a soccer expert - I played rec league and high school, but never higher than JV, so take my opinions here with a grain of salt. There were delays on the Green Line getting home, too. Everything seemed cool at first, since most of the stadium was still sticking around, waiting to see if they would resume the game, when we left. So the train from RFK wasn't full, and usually once we transfer to Green it's smooth sailing. But it took us a half hour to get from Shaw to Columbia Heights. If my foot wasn't busted up, we could have walked it in that time. Anyway, more pictures [here](http://flickr.com/photos/thetejon/sets/72157606349011591/).
