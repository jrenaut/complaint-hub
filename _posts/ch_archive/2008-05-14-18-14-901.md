I've been pretty underwhelmed by [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) 8.04 - Hardy Heron. I upgraded from 7.10, which I was pretty happy with, and I'd kind of like to go back. I haven't been getting crashes or freezes or anything like that, but it's not more polished and stable than 7.10. Also, Firefox 3 Beta is annoying. A couple of the plugins I really like for Firefox 2 don't work yet, and the new features aren't cool enough to make it worth the upgrade for me. I also suspect some of my dissatisfaction is not 8.04's fault - the lack of 64 bit Linux support in Adobe's Flash is a huge pain. There are some websites that just don't work without Flash (Some of them, like Google Analytics, are actually useful). And I can't get Flash to work anymore. But it wasn't working in 7.10, either. Anyway, I just downloaded and burned a live cd for [Fedora 9](http://fedoraproject.org/), and I think I'm going to try it out. I don't know if I'll replace Ubuntu, but it's worth a try. I can still be a smug Linux convert with Fedora. Maybe even smugger because Ubuntu is more mainstream than Fedora.
