Bad timing for some big news items. I haven't had a chance to write about Gerald Ford, even though I flew out of an airport named after him last week. I haven't had a chance to write about Saddam Hussein, in part because I'm still not sure how I feel about the whole thing, which is puzzling. I haven't written about New Year's, which contains a small complaint about the cab companies in Annapolis, Maryland, who were woefully unprepared for the demand.

So, either I'll get to all that, and whatever else I missed, or I won't. That's the nice part about not doing this for a living. You can always [complain yourself](http://www.submissions.complainthub.com) if I've missed something really glaring.
