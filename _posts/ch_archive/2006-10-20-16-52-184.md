[GOP terrorism ad sparks Democratic furor - CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/10/20/gop.ad/index.html?eref=rss_topstories)

I haven't seen this ad.  I don't need to see it.  I'm voting, and whatever the ad is, it won't affect my vote.  But I hope people are angry about it.  I hope it pisses off hundreds of thousands of people and maybe some of them will actually get up and vote.

I would rather see 90% of the registered voters elect Bill Frist or Hillary Clinton President than 10% of the registered voters elect someone who isn't a minion of Satan.  If the vast majority of the country disagrees with me on who should run the country, fine.  I'll accept that.  But if we don't know who the vast majority of the country prefers because most of them don't bother to exercise their Constitutional right to tell us, then I'm pissed off.
