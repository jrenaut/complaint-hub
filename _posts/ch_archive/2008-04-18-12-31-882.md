I got a Cherry Coke out of the machine down the hall to drink with my lunch. I don't drink nearly as much soda as I used to, but every now and then I can't help it. This time, I should have been more careful in my selection. It wasn't actually a Cherry Coke - it was a Cherry Coke Zero. That means they've taken out all the delicious high fructose corn syrup and replaced it with [carcinogens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartame) that fool your tongue into thinking you're consuming something sweet. I know my view on this is a little extreme, but I'd like to see Coke and anyone else who wants to use aspartame and sucralose and all those other non-food products have to put a big disclaimer on the package, like a cigarette warning. 

> WARNING - this product contains a chemical substance posing as food that is not, in fact, digestible by humans. It tricks your taste buds into thinking it's sweet, but it is all a lie. Also, there is non-trivial evidence suggesting it causes cancer. If you still think it's better than high-fructose corn syrup, go ahead and enjoy.
