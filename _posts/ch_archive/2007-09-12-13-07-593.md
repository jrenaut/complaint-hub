You know that sound they play in every Western ever made, when the bad guy is staring down the good guy?  I can't describe the noise, but you know what I'm talking about.

Anyway, some clown down the hall from me at work has that as his cell phone ringtone.

I'm not going to do it, but let's just say, hypothetically, that the phone rang for a third time in the last half hour, and I hypothetically removed one or both of his arms and beat him with it/them.  Hypothetically.

Do you think I would do any jail time?
