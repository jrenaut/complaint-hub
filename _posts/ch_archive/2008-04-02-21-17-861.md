There is NO EXCUSE for [five walks in four innings](http://mlb.mlb.com/news/boxscore.jsp?gid=2008_04_02_tbamlb_balmlb_1). Looking at [Daniel Cabrera's career stats](http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/cabreda01.shtml) is an exercise in frustration. In 2006, for example, he struck out 157 in 148 innings. But he led the league in walks allowed and wild pitches. In 2007, he repeated as the league leader in walks. He capped it off by also leading the league in runs allowed and losses. A friend of mine who plays baseball (amateur, but competitive) says Cabrera has the best stuff he's ever seen. If you pick through his individual outings, you'll find some games where he was absolutely unhittable ([here](http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BAL/BAL200505030.shtml), [here](http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BAL/BAL200505090.shtml), [here](http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BAL/BAL200509060.shtml)) and some games where no one had to hit him, they could just wait for the walk ([here](http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/TEX/TEX200508060.shtml), [here](http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BAL/BAL200709120.shtml), and _shudder_ [here](http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BAL/BAL200604070.shtml)). He is obviously an immensely talented pitcher, but at nearly 27, he's probably not going to suddenly learn control. Unfortunately for the Orioles, the rest of the league knows that, too.
