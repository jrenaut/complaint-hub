It's been about three and a half hours since [I complained](/node/901) about the lack of 64 bit Flash for Linux. Just a minute ago, I was checking out the latest on my RSS feed, and there was a Flash video on [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net). Firefox popped up the little message, asking if I wanted to install the plugin. I figured it wouldn't work, but I did it anyway. The package manager installed flashplugin-nonfree, and it worked! I can watch YouTube videos! I can use Google Analytics! Even MLB GameDay works! It's amazing! So, I apologize, [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com). You've been so good to me, and I nearly kicked you to the curb just because Fedora put out a new distro. But I'm back now. I'm right back on the Ubuntu bandwagon. On a side note, I'm available for freelance complaining. This is not the first time I've complained about something that was magically fixed soon afterwards. For a very reasonable hourly rate, I'll complain about something that you'd like fixed. _Results not guaranteed. Nor even expected._
