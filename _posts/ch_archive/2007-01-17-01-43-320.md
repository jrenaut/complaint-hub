[VentBox â„¢ » VentBox is comingâ€¦ real soon (beta invite)](http://blog.ventbox.com/2007/01/16/ventbox-is-coming-real-soon-beta-invite/)

My co-complainer over at VentBox is releasing a beta version of his complaint (vent) submission site.  It's way more web 2.0 than [mine](http://www.submissions.complainthub.com), and much more involved and well-done.   Anyway, go get a beta invitation and check it out.
