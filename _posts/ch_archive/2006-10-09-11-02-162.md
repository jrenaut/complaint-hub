Our office is all but closed today, and I got permission to work from home (Mostly because I'm pretty sure I'm technically supposed to do the combination lock on the office door every time I go to the bathroom if I'm the only one there).  And what's even better is that my assignment for the day is to get [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) up and running with the [Google Web Toolkit](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) and see if I can get an environment set up to write some web services.  I'm thinking I might try writing a little something for Complaint Hub if I can get it working (And playing nicely with the WordPress php theme that I'm using).  Maybe I'll put up a little [Nano](http://www.nanowrimo.org) progress bar so you all can yell at me if I start falling behind next month.
