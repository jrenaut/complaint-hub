Well, not really.  We need the rain.  But it's messing up my weekend.  We have flag football on Saturday morning, and my mother-in-law will be in town from far away, and wanted to see the game.  My mom was going to come from less far away, and everyone was going to watch.  But since it's been raining for two days now, and isn't expected to stop until Saturday afternoon, it's looking increasingly unlikely that we'll be able to play.

This probably also doesn't help the wife's plans to take her mom around the city tomorrow.

On the bright side, it's been so long since I've actually seen rain that it was really kind of nice.  It wasn't raining that hard when I was outside, and it's still warm enough to be pleasant.  As I was waiting to cross 16th Street yesterday, I watched the rain run down the windshield of a Ford Explorer that was blocking the crosswalk as the light was changing.

As I stood there watching, I wondered if anyone had ever uttered the phrase, "The warm rain running down the windshield of your 1993 Ford Explorer is hauntingly beautiful."

Then I wondered if I had accidentally ingested some drugs without knowing it.

But then I decided that it's just my subconscious getting ready for [Nanowrimo](http://www.nanowrimo.org).

Anyway, we need the rain.  But it sure would be nice if the fields were dry enough to play on this Saturday morning.
