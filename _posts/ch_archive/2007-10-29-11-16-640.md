A little while back, [I said](?p=643) if the Bookean Cybook Gen3 ebook reader was less than $300, I would buy it.  So it was [released today](http://www.bookeen.com/shop/ebook-shop.aspx), and it's $350, or $450 with some extra accessories.

I still want one.  I'd love to be able to play with it first, but I may not be able to resist.  I mean, why did I go to college if it wasn't to get a job so I could afford to spend $350 on totally awesome gadgets now and then?
