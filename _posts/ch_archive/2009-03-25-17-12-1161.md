Correct me if I'm wrong, but when one quotes another source, one generally doesn't edit the quote to change the meaning, right? I mean, I didn't study journalism in school, so I might be crazy here, but I always thought you were supposed to write exactly what the other person wrote or said, unless you make it clear that you've changed the wording. And even then, you change the wording either to clarify the context or to fit in the allowed space. You don't change the meaning of the quote. Also, the wife maintains that "tilt" is generally used instead of "joust" when making that particular reference. She also feels that the analogy is slightly flawed - parking enforcement is an actual enemy, so to speak, unlike the windmills. We had a nice discussion about it, and we decided that she should just let me handle the references to classical literature. At least, that's what I came away with. And she doesn't have a blog, so that makes me right.
