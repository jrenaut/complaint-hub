Sorry, commenter Zac Boyd.  Looks like Brian Roberts did take steroids.  But, he did it before it was officially banned by baseball (Nice job, Bud Selig.  You are truly an asset to the game of baseball). And he only did it once.  And now he's apologized.

I know I came out and said that everyone on the list should be released, but I'm taking that back.  Everyone who takes responsibility and seems to honestly be sorry can stay.  We'll just wag our fingers at them.

I'm inclined to believe Roberts, in part because I like him and I want to believe him.  And he hasn't done anything to make him untrustworthy.  He hasn't been in the news getting in trouble, he has a reputation as a nice guy.

Roger Clemens, on the other hand, is a big jerk.
