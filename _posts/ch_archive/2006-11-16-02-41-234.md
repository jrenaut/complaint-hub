I should really be getting to bed, since I woke up at five this morning and couldn't get back to sleep (Then made the mistake, without thinking, of complaining about not sleeping to the guy in the office with a two week old baby in the house).  But I just crossed the 30,000 word mark three days ahead of schedule, and I can't quite bring myself to go to bed.  I don't have much more time to write tonight, as anything after midnight counts as tomorrow, but I suppose that doesn't really matter.  All the words count towards the total.

The story is going well.  I have a lot more characters in this novel than I have in previous novels, and I'm often surprised at which ones are taking central roles.  Some of the ones I thought would be important have stepped back so that others could get more time in front of the camera.  That's one of the cool things about writing like this.  Stuff just happens.

Anyway, I have to get back to writing about the meeting between my disgruntled blogger and the wife of the executive.  He just broke the news to her this morning that her husband is cheating on her, and now they're having dinner in the lobby of the hotel where she's staying.
