The Super Bowl ads have gone too far.  It's not enough that many people watch the game just for the ads.  Although it supports the point that [Techdirt](http://www.techdirt.com) makes all the time - make ads interesting and people don't mind watching them.  Now we have CareerBuilder advertising that they're going in a new direction with their Super Bowl ads (I did like the monkeys.  Although I often forgot what was being advertised), and Rolling Rock pretending to apologize in advance for a commercial about men wearing thongs.

In any event, it suggests something fundamentally wrong with us as a society when we have advertisements trying to get us to watch other advertisements.  I suppose they always have to push it one step further - eventually even the most shocking thing gets to be normal, so you have to take the next step.  But this is a step that I think we all will soon be regretting.  It's like Christmas decorations before Halloween.  They keep expanding the holiday.  And the Super Bowl is not that different.  It's just like Christmas, except without the whole religious aspect.
