[Welcome to Lightning Car Company - The UK's Premier Electric Sports Car ](http://www.lightningcarcompany.com/home.php) via [Inhabitat](http://inhabitat.com/)

A fully electric right-hand drive convertible that does 0-60 in four seconds? I'm drooling right now.

So they're asking for a deposit that comes out to over $100,000 based on the horrific weakness of the dollar against the pound. It looks like an old Jaguar, from back when they knew how to make a pretty car.

They do plan to send them over to the US.Â  Can someone loan me some cash?
