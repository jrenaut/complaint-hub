[The Fantasy Of Happily Ever After - washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/08/AR2007020802435.html?nav=rss_email/components)

I won't pull a quote from the article, because you should really read the whole thing.  Any article with references to Tolstoy and Newt Gingrich while calling Anna Nicole Smith a modern courtesan is just something that everyone should read.

I'm not sure what the author, [Philip Kennicott](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/staff/articles/philip+kennicott/), was trying to do with the article.  Perhaps it was subtle satire of of our star-obsessed culture.  Perhaps he hoped to educate us on the ridiculousness of putting people like Anna Nicole on a pedestal.  Perhaps he was really, really high.  I don't know.  All I know is that the article made me laugh.
