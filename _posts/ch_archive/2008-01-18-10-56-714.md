[PCs: Ripple-Mini PC Packs an Awful Lot of Computing into $132](http://gizmodo.com/346389/ripple+mini-pc-packs-an-awful-lot-of-computing-into-132)

> The device, which will retail for a shockingly low €90 ($132), will pack in an Intel Celeron M215 (1.33GHz), 1GB RAM, SiS 662 North Bridge and SiS 964L South Bridge, all in a dinky 20x300x220mm, Mac mini-esque case.

Why can't we have these over here?  I'd gladly pay $132 for this thing.  In fact, I'd put one in every room of the house.  I'd add a little 7" touchscreen and mount one under the cabinets in the kitchen and use it for recipes.  I'd put one in the bathroom just to annoy the wife.  I'd even buy one for the cat.

I can't wait until computers like this hit that magical price point where it's not longer a big purchase that you think about for a while, but a "Hey, can you pick up another computer on your way home from work today?" kind of purchase.
