First, there was the Slashdot post about [Mac nerds switching to Ubuntu](http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/07/03/1934251). Then I saw that someone I've met in real life [uses Ubuntu](http://www.midnightcheese.com/index.php?p=385). Since I've always thought that I couldn't really claim that I was a computer geek unless I had at least one computer running Linux (And my previous attempt at running [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) was a failure), I thought, why not follow [Cory's lead](http://www.boingboing.net) and check out [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com).  So far, it's pretty cool.  I had some issues getting my resolution to display at anything but 640X480, and I still don't have my wireless card working (Although I'm not sure it ever worked that well when I was running Windows, either), I'm liking the Linux.  Ubuntu comes with a pretty slick GUI, and a lot of the stuff you need - Firefox, OpenOffice, Gimp . . .

And it's keeping my old Dell P3 500mhz from sitting in a corner collecting dust.  I bought the computer in 1998, and it's treated me well.  Now I think I can get a little more use out of it.

My fiancee tells me that I'm running Linux because I want to be able to look down my nose at you silly Windows users, and she's not entirely off-base.  There is a certain part of me that yearns to be snooty to everyone else.  But I try to keep that part in check.  Sometimes I even manage to do it.
