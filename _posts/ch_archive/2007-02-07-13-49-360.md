[McSweeney's Internet Tendency: The Americans Who Voted for George W. Bush Wish to Return Their Television.](http://mcsweeneys.net/2007/2/6gladstone.html)

McSweeney's is a frequently hysterical satire site that I never remember to look at because they don't have a friggin' RSS feed.  I don't know what they're trying to accomplish - they don't have ads that you'd miss out on if you looked at the RSS instead of the main site.  There is no reason I can imagine.  And yet still no RSS feed.  On the bright side, when I do remember, there's usually a bunch of new stuff since the last time I was there.
