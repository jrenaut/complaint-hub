[Making Light | Phase one: collect underpants](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/010044.html) via [Whatever](http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=480) Tor Books, a big (the biggest?) name in science fiction publishing, is opening a new website. It is supposed to be "a place and a context for the lively, ongoing, wide-ranging, and profoundly self-organizing discussions that have characterized the science fiction subculture since its earliest days". That sounds pretty cool to me. I [signed up](http://www.tor.com) for their advanced membership or whatever it is to get some free ebook downloads. I haven't read any of them, because I don't have an ebook reader (Please, won't someone make a good, affordable ebook reader?). But I have them, and I plan to read some or all of them, and I suspect that I will end up buying something from some or all of the authors that I read. I hate announcements of far away website launches - I don't really care until your site is live. Actually, I don't really care until it's live and finished being Dugg and Slashdotted, which I'm sure it will be. But I am looking forward to this. I was really disappointed with Gawker's [crappy science fiction blog](http://www.io9.com), and I have high hopes for this one.
