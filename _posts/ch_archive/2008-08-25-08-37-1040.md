In the [Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/24/AR2008082402088.html) today, via my mom, there are improvements coming to the strip of 14th Street north of Park. For some of you, that may just be "the area around the Red Derby". But keep an eye out for some new stuff. 

> [[the Mid-14th Street Business Association](http://www.mid14thstreet.com/index.html)], in conjunction with a District-based nonprofit organization, the Latino Economic Development Corp., has begun an effort to add fresh layers of paint and new signs to many of the businesses. The business association also plans to launch seminars catered to the shop owners starting in September. Rosemarie Salguero, executive director of the association, said one of the goals is to brand the area as a hub of Central American culture. 

If I'm lucky, maybe a Costa Rican restaurant will open up and serve some nice casados and gallo pinto.
