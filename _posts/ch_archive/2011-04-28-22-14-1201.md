We had another date night tonight. The wife's ingredients were rhubarb and garlic, so she cooked [rhubarb salad with goat cheese](http://www.marthastewart.com/262738/rhubarb-salad-with-goat-cheese?czone=food%2Fproduce-guide-cnt%2Fspring-produce-recipes). Except they didn't have rhubarb at Whole Foods, so she subbed in apple. It worked. My ingredients were veggie chorizo sausage and phyllo dough (since we didn't finish it from last time). I made **Spicy Pigs in a Blanket with Lime Salsa**. It was pretty good.

  * Phyllo dough
  * Veggie Chorizo
  * Granny Smith Apple
  * Tiny bit of olive oil
  * Cooking spray
Salsa 
  * 2 roma tomatoes
  * 1 red pepper
  * 1 lime
  * 1/2 can great northern beans
  * Small handful of cilantro
  * Largish pinch of salt
Directions Chop the sausage and the apple into pretty small pieces and mix together. Double over the phyllo dough, sealing with olive oil. Cut into strips a couple inches wide. Put a bit of the apple/sausage mixture onto the dough and roll it up. Technique isn't important here. Cook at 375 for 12 minutes or until the dough starts to brown. Chop and seed the tomatoes. Chop the pepper. Rinse the beans. Toss all into a bowl. Chop and add the cilantro, add the salt. Add most of the zest from the lime, as well as all the juice. Toss. That's it. I served it all together, but each one stands up on its own if you're so inclined. So, I'm pretty much the best cook ever. And I say that with all appropriate modesty.
