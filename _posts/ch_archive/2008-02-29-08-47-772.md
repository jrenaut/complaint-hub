Oops. I was playing around with CSS last night and never bothered to check the site in Internet Explorer 6. So if you're using that contemptible piece of junk to view the site, you're going to see the right sidebar in the wrong place. Unless you're at work, or somewhere else where you can't change your browser, you really, really should go get a real browser. I am a huge advocate of [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com). It is a better browser than IE in almost every way, and it's free. You should try it. Anyway, I'll fix the CSS at some point, but it will probably be over the weekend. For now, you're out of luck.
