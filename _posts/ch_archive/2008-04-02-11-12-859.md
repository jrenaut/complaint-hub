[This article](http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080331&content_id=2473633&vkey=news_bal&fext=.jsp&c_id=bal) caught my eye because [Alex Cintron](http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/cintral01.shtml) was my shortstop in MLB 2005 for the Gamecube after I dumped Tejada - the game decided his skills were declining, and he cost too much money. And now the real Orioles have signed him. Well, great. At age 24, this kid looked like an up-and-coming star. He hit .317 with a 112 OPS+, which are pretty nice numbers for a middle infielder. Unfortunately, he'll be 30 this year, and his numbers haven't even approached average since that season. I suppose he's only expected to back up one of the two kids ([Fahey](http://www.baseball-reference.com/f/faheybr01.shtml) and [Hernandez](http://www.baseball-reference.com/h/hernalu01.shtml), neither of whom can hit, either), but it seems to me that Cintron doesn't have the ability to be a good backup, or the experience to be a good mentor.
