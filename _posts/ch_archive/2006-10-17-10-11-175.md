I'm still unhappy with the result of [my inquiry to the DMV about Seven Corners](http://www.complainthub.com/?p=128). Today, as usual, someone wanted to be in my lane. And it's dark when I go through the intersection at this time of year, and raining this morning. It just makes it worse.

So I've decided to do something about it. I just wrote a letter to Congressman Jim Moran, 8th District of Virginia. I've decided that I should write more letters to my representatives. I may write to Tim Kaine and complain about his treatment of my wife when she volunteered for him (He never sent even a mass-email thank you). I'll write to my Senator about this same issue at Seven Corners.

I invite all of you to write your representatives, as well. If you send me a copy of the letter, I'll post it here. Then you'll be famous with ten to twenty people a day just like I am.

_Edit: I sent the letter to Senators Warner and Allen as well. You can see that letter, and the future letters I plan to write, once I write them, by clicking the "Angry Letters" link at the top of the page._
