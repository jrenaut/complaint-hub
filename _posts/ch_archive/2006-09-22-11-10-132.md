[ESPN.com - MLB - 'Free the birds': Fans walk out in protest](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2597721)

> "When you get down to facts, putting together a team that can compete in the AL East means having a payroll between $100 million-$110 million. That money comes from the consumer, and I have chosen to keep ticket prices to a minimum.

Let's just see how many teams have a lower payroll than the Orioles, and a better record. Toronto, San Diego, Texas, Minnesota, Oakland, Cincinnati, Arizona, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Colorado, and Florida. Hmm. And look at that, Toronto is in the AL East. They made huge free agent signings over the winter to not win the division. It might take $100 million to win the division, but it doesn't take $100 million to finish above .500.

For the record, I know it's hard to compete with the Yankees and Red Sox. I understand that. But spending a ton of money is NOT the answer.

I'm not sure how I feel about the staged walkout at Camden Yards to protest Angelos. It doesn't seem like it's going to get anyone anywhere. Is Angelos going to sell the team because 1000 fans walked out? I'm going to have to say that's unlikely. Is he going to change the way he does things? Well, if nine straight losing seasons hasn't changed him, I don't think 1000 angry fans will, either.
