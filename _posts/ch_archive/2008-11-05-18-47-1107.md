No, not the election yesterday, though that certainly was glorious. I don't have time to do justice to the election, so I will just say that I have never seen people dancing in the streets over a President, and I'm looking forward to the coming years. The glorious thing I'm talking about is the search box in Firefox 3. I was making a dumb joke in my [novel](http://www.nanowrimo.org) about Keira Knightley. I don't know about you, but I didn't know how to spell her name. So I went to the search box with its awesome autocomplete. By the time I had typed "kie", which is _not_ how you spell her name, the first result was her name, spelled correctly. Now, keep in mind, I didn't actually perform the search, I just looked at the suggestions that Firefox gives for what I might want to search for. Actually, I did do the search, but just to verify that I had the correct spelling. I did. Can you imagine this sort of information so readily available even five years ago? Sure, it wouldn't have been hard for me to find out how to spell her name. But the only way it would have been easier this time is if the Open Office standard dictionary was hooked up to some online dictionary that was constantly updated. So maybe someone should get on that.
