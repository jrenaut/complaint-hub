Construction is set to begin tomorrow, according to the contractor.  They're going to put a dumpster in our driveway for a couple of hours.  While I'm not looking forward to the noise and mess and whatnot, it's exciting that something's going to happen to the house.  I would much rather have a renovated house on the block than a boarded up one.  It means we're going to have to put up the blinds in our bedroom.  Currently, the only way to see in is through a boarded up window, but that probably won't be boarded up for long.
