I [wrote to Jim Graham today](?page_id=587).  I'm looking for a little help on [my parking ticket problems](?p=580).  I figure that taking up Graham's time is more efficient than taking up the time of a clerk in the DC traffic courts - Graham's time is billed at a much higher rate, and it will take less time to reach the $60 they're trying to take from me.

When I hear back, I'll let you all know.  And then I'll contest my tickets.
