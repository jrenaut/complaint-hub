[![DSC_8606](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2104/2411980836_eec5ae360c_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/2411980836/)The fifth annual [Race to Stop the Silence](http://www.stopcsa.org/RACE/) took place yesterday. I ran it [last year](/node/429), too, finishing in 55:04. This year, I reached my personal goal of a sub-50-minute finish, coming in at 49:38. There are more pictures [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/sets/72157604525530003/), thanks to the wife. She and the mother-in-law and Phil came to watch on a brisk early morning, and I was glad to put on a good show. The course was moved from West Potomac Park to Anacostia this year, and I wasn't expecting much. But the course wasn't bad. It was a 5K course, two laps, which wasn't ideal. And I was afraid it would get crowded. But with only 428 runners (I finished 166th overall), it didn't get too bad. I don't have any more races scheduled for this year. I'd like to get a pace time under eight minutes (This one was 8:01) as my next goal. Maybe I'll find another one before it gets too hot.
