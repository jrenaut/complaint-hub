We're finally going out looking at new places today.  We've decided to see if we can keep the place I own now, rent it out, and still manage to buy a new place.  If it works, it will be great, because eventually we'll have rental income from this place, and it will always be sort of a savings account.  And if it turns out we can't afford it (We can't rent it right now for the amount of the mortgage), we can sell as investors rather than residents, and the taxes work out much more nicely.

So, anyone looking to rent a lovely two-bedroom condo, conveniently located in beautiful Falls Church, Virginia?  Near Metro, 66, 495, Tyson's Corner . . .  We'll probably be advertising on [Craigslist](http://washingtondc.craigslist.com) soon.
