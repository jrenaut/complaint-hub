[The Jeff Pulver Blog: Some thoughts on the Google Purchase of YouTube:](http://pulverblog.pulver.com/archives/005754.html)

Some interesting speculation here.  Jeff Pulver thinks (hopes?) that this could mean a real step forward towards internet TV.  The combination of YouTube's community with Google's developers and resources could be the start of a real alternative to cable/satellite TV.

That could be really cool.  An entirely new model for distributing mainstream video entertainment.  Maybe we'd finally stop being stuck with this antiquated "this show is on at this time" system.  You'd think that the popularity of Tivo and DVR would suggest that maybe people don't like being forced to watch a show at a specific time, but the networks don't seem to want to deliver what people want.
