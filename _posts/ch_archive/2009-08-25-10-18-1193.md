Sony has a new (I think) website up to promote their new ebook readers - [Words Move Me](http://www.wordsmoveme.com/reader/). They ask people to sign up and share words that move them. Perhaps a favorite quote from a novel, or something like that. So I [shared mine](http://www.wordsmoveme.com/reader/entry/?id=4640786646948112457). For context, see [this NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/19/business/media/19online.html).
