[Report: Vice president's lesbian daughter pregnant - CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/12/06/cheney.daughters.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories)

> Mary Cheney, 37, and her partner of 15 years, Heather Poe, 45, are "ecstatic" about the baby, due in late spring . . .

I like how CNN had to make sure they mention in the headline that she's a lesbian.Â  That's because everyone knows that lesbians have babies with two heads and shoot beams from their eyes that turn straight people to gay.
