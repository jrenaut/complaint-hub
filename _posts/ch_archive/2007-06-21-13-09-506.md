[Why Less Brilliant Presidents Do Better](http://blogs.wsj.com/informedreader/2007/06/18/a-possible-reason-why-dumber-presidents-do-better/)

I'm sorry, boss, but I'm too smart to be a good manager.  Although I suppose that would probably backfire, as if we assume this is true, it follows that it's extremely unlikely that I will get dumber and therefore improve my managerial skills.

However, when you have a sample size as small as the number of US Presidents (43?  Is that how many we've had?  I forget.  Less than 50, anyway), and you can list two exceptions - he mentions Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt - one starts to doubt the hypothesis.

Never mind how difficult it is to really measure intelligence.

Still, it's an interesting thought, if not a new one.  And it doesn't make me want to vote for the dumbest person running.
