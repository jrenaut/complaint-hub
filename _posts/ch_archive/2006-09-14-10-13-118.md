[For 1st Woman With Bionic Arm, a New Life Is Within Reach - washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/13/AR2006091302271.html?nav=rss_email/components)

Today, the first woman gets a bionic arm to replace one she lost.  Sooner than you think, a plastic surgeon is going to amputate the arms of a rich bored kid to replace them with metal arms as a fashion statement or a "body upgrade".

I think it's great that people without limbs have this available - a partially thought-controlled replacement arm.  I know how difficult it can be to do normal tasks when I've just jammed a wrist or something - I can't even imagine losing a limb.  And while this technology isn't perfect, I imagine an imperfect arm is better than no arm.

But it's a new world out there, and it's only a matter of time before this is cosmetic surgery.  It remains to be seen whether that's a good thing or a bad thing.
