If you need any sort of running gear, go to [Fleet Feet](http://fleetfeetdc.com/). However, unless you really have to (And I know I linked to it), don't go to their website. It resized my browser window, which is absolutely unacceptable.

However, the service at the store is fantastic. At the end of May I bought a new pair of running shoes. I've since put probably 40 miles on them. There is now a hole worn in the heel on the inside of the left shoe. This seems a little ridiculous.

So, I went to Fleet Feet, where they promptly exchanged the pair of shoes for a new one. I hope it was just a defective pair, because I really like the shoes. And I have weird, skinny, flat, bony feet. It's really hard to find shoes that fit me.

Anyway, I have been very happy with my experience at Fleet Feet. I'll definitely go back next time I need something. Just hopefully not for these shoes again.
