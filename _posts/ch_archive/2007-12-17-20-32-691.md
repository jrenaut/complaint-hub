Or am I misremembering?  I could have sworn that they asked me if I wanted to register to vote in DC when I got my DC license.  Now, I know me, and I would have said, "Yes, I would like to register to vote while I get my DC license".  I've known me a long time, and I feel qualified to speculate on what I might have said in that situation.

It turns out that either they didn't ask, or they didn't act on my request, because I'm not registered to vote in DC.  With primaries coming up, and a whole gaggle of clowns on both sides of the ballot, this is just not acceptable.  Now, I still have to figure out who to vote for - there's no one I really like, and every time I try to eliminate the people I absolutely can't bring myself to vote for, I'm left with a write-in for either Abraham Lincoln or Donald Duck.

In any event, downloaded and printed the PDF, filled it out, and I'll mail it on my way to work tomorrow.  It's actually quite easy for [DC residents to determine if they're registered to vote](http://www.dcboee.org/voterreg/vic_step1.asp).  If you aren't, you should be, and you should vote.  If you don't vote, you can't complain, and if you can't complain, I'm not really sure what else you're doing, but it's probably un-American.
