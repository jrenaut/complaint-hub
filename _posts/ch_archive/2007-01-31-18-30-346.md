So here's the view from the hallway looking forward. The place is beautiful. There were some minor problems that came up during the inspection - the showers don't drain that well, the water shut-off is kind of hidden behind the washing machine . . .

But nothing they can't fix. And parking wasn't too bad. I don't know what I'm going to do before I get my car registered in DC, though. It's 2 hour parking unless you have a sticker. I guess I'll have to do that sooner rather than later.

The drive wasn't bad, either. I came from work, although I left work at 2:30, so traffic shouldn't be bad. But it wasn't bad coming home at 4:30, either. People say traffic in the city is bad, but it's really not the city. It's the suburbs where the traffic will kill you.

You have no idea how excited I am to move.
