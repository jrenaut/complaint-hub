Everyone's favorite DRM-hater, Cory Doctorow, has pointed us to [yet another "DRM server shut down so the content you 'purchased' goes away" story](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/01/08/ebook-drm-provider-g.html). [Walmart](/blog/walmart-caves-drm), [Yahoo](/blog/way-go-yahoo), [Microsoft](/where-microsoft-went-yahoo-will-follow), now Fictionwise . . . None of them seem to understand the problem with DRM. I've stopped buying infinitely copyable goods. i don't believe in pirating software or music, but I refuse to pay for something that should be free. That's part of the reason I'm using Linux, listening to music on [Jamendo](http://www.jamendo.com), and things like that. They recognize that you can give away the infinite goods and use them to increase the value of the related scarce goods. I will not purchase anything with any sort of DRM on it. And you shouldn't either.
