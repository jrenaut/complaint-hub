[Complaint Hub » Blog Archive » Miro needs your help to not suck](http://www.blog.complainthub.com/?p=617)

> I really do hope the Miro project succeeds and gives us another model for distributing quality video content. But I’m not giving them money when they beg. Provide me with a service that I want, that works the way it should, and I’ll pay for it. But try to get me to donate money to a bloated piece of software that I’m not entirely sure fulfills the needs of anyone, and I’m just not interested.

Just to show that I'm not holding a grudge, I just installed Miro 1.0 on my laptop.  I'm going to wait until I at least hit 1,667 words for the day before I play with it, but I'm going to try it out.  I'll post my thoughts when I get a chance to see how it works.
