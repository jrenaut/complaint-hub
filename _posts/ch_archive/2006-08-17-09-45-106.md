[Suspect Held in Ramsey Slaying](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/17/AR2006081700175.html?nav=rss_email/components)

First, I can't believe it's been ten years since JonBenet was killed.  Second, I had no idea anyone still cared.  But apparently they arrested some guy in Thailand, who claims the whole thing was an accident.  I'm sure everyone will believe that.  When you get arrested on sex charges, and happen to admit that you were involved with the "accidental" death of a six-year-old beauty queen, most people are going to throw the whole "innocent until proven guilty" thing out the window. I wonder if this will be all over the news again.  They LOVE showing the pictures of her with eight pounds of makeup on.
