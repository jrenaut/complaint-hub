> â€œI think Creative Commons is a huge thing and I attribute a lot of my success to it,â€ Krug said. â€œSince the beginning Iâ€™ve given all my photos away on the Internet and theyâ€™ve been used by other bloggers and people all along the way and itâ€™s gotten my name out there.

Article is about a photographer who has shared his high quality photos under a [Creative Commons license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_commons), and how it's gotten his name out there.  Are you listening, music industry?

I have about [1500 photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon) shared on Flickr under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike license.  That means anyone can use the photo for whatever they want as long as theygive me credit, don't make money from it, and keep the license the same.  I've never had anyone I don't know use a photo (To my knowledge), but I know at least one friend has used a few as desktop backgrounds, which is cool.  And I'm not a professional photographer or anything, but I have an expensive [DSLR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dslr) and I more or less know how to use it.

Anyway, good to hear Creative Commons success stories.
