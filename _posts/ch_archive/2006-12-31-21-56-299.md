I know, it's early for almost all of my usual readers, who tend to be in the United States.  But I won't be near a computer at midnight.  Actually, I might be, but I'm pretty sure I won't be sitting down to post something about it.  The wife and I are running late for a party at a friend's house.  We were planning to leave ten minutes ago, and we are not walking out the door yet.  But that's okay.

Anyway, it's been a good year.  I'm not going to summarize now.  Maybe tomorrow.
