Over the weekend, I noticed that someone stole the [Bell's Beer](http://www.bellsbeer.com/) sticker off the back window of our car. It may have happened over Halloween, I haven't been paying that much attention to the car. I like to think that the person who did it felt that I was promoting drinking and driving, and stole the sticker as a protest. I wasn't, for the record, promoting drinking and driving - one of the huge advantages about living somewhere like Columbia Heights is that there are tons of places you can go drink where you never ever ever have to drive home. Wonderland, Marx Cafe, Saint Ex, all fantastic bars that I can walk to easily, not to mention everything on U Street and Adams Morgan. Anyway, if the person felt I was making a statement like that, then I forgive you for your misguided attempt to make the world a better place. If not, however, I hope you got a paper cut from the sticker. It's not a big deal in either case - those stickers only last a year or so, and I'll be back in Kalamazoo next month, when I planned to get a new sticker anyway. If anyone who works for Bell's is listening - how about some inside-window stickers so it's safe from the elements and from would-be thieves?
