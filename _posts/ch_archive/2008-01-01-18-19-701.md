[alli –weight loss program for healthy weight loss](http://myalli.com/)

Take a look at the link above.  I keep seeing this commercial while the wife watches various Law and Order marathons while she pretends she's doing work.

The first thing I thought when I saw the logo was "Google".  I imagine that was intentional, and I imagine their lawyers have determined that they haven't crossed any lines, but it seems like they must have come pretty close.

Not only that, but their red-blue-yellow-green letters mirror eBay's, too.

Now, eBay doesn't have much of a sense of humor, so I imagine if they determine they don't have a case, they'll let it go, just mutter to each other at the corporate office.

Google, however, ought to send a nice little note to GlaxoSmithKline, makers of Alli, and tell them in no uncertain terms that they're a bunch of dicks.  They probably won't, but it would be cool.

Where do you draw the line between a similar logo and an attempt to piggyback on the good name of another company?  Alli is really, really close to that line if they haven't actually crossed it.  They aren't competing with eBay or Google, but that's not really the issue.
