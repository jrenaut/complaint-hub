[Cribcandy - the household shopping blog. Daily picks of the best designed or most unusual finds, for your home](http://www.cribcandy.com/) link via [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net) This site probably requires a little more browsing before I understand where they're going, but they seem to be trying to create a social web app for shopping. I'm not sure what value they expect to add, but the stuff they find for around the house is awesome. And it doesn't seem to be all super expensive, unlike many sites that aggregate cool stuff.
