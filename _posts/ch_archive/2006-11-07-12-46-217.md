[NPR : Helium Shortage Looms for United States](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6444180)

> Helium balloon fans -- of whatever age -- shouldn't worry about a shortage, however: The balloons suck up only 8 percent of the helium stock.

Well, that's good to hear.  I don't know what we'd do without helium balloons.   It's a little surprising, though, that 8 percent of all the helium in the country is used for balloons.  I mean, not to knock birthday decorations and whatnot, but do we really need to use that much for something that lasts only a few days at best?
