If the site looks like crap, sorry.  If you're using Internet Explorer, it'll probably look really bad.  For that, I'm less sorry.  You shouldn't be using that browser anyway.

I'm still working on it.  If I don't get too distracted by [Script Frenzy](http://www.scriptfrenzy.org), I'll finish fixing it pretty soon.
