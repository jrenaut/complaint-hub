According to the DC Department of Transportation website, our block is NOT zoned residential.  Neither side.  My guess is that the sign says "residential" because they don't make custom signs for our weird un-zoned street.  I printed out the DDOT search page showing that our block isn't zoned residential, and we'll be contesting this ticket.
