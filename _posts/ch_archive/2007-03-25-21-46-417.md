[International Race to Stop the Silence](http://www.stopcsa.org/RACE/)

I'm really getting into this running thing, apparently. Three weeks from today, I'm going to do my first 10K race. I've never actually run that far, so this should be interesting. And the race fights child sexual abuse. I'm opposed to child sexual abuse. I imagine most people are.

My wife is actually not looking at me like I'm insane as I do this, so that's a good sign. I mean, 10K is not all that far. 6.2 miles. I ran 4.1 today. I can do 6.2. I don't think I'm going to finish at the top of my age group, but I don't think I'm going to embarrass myself.

Anyway, it should be fun. And I'll even have a few hours afterwards before flag football.
