_I'm sort of live-blogging my Ubuntu install.  The following would probably be more interesting if it actually, you know, worked. _

So, we just finished some delicious [Saag Aloo](http://vegweb.com/index.php?topic=12612.0), and now I'm going to install Gutsy while the wife watches Law and Order: SVU.

I've got a black screen so far. That's not good. BTW, I'm writing here on my old laptop while I install on the new one. Just FYI.

I just got a warning, telling me that Ubuntu is running in low graphics mode. That's not cool. I chose 1440X900 from the "generic" monitor resolution list. Now it's running local boot scripts. This doesn't seem good. I was kind of hoping it would just boot up without my input. I'm staying postive, though.

I just ctrl-alt-deleted. It wasn't doing anything.

I tried the default 800X600 resolution this time. Now it's running local boot scripts again. I'm not optimistic.

This Live CD stuff just isn't working. I'm downloading the alternate install cd now. I'll be back in an hour or so.
