[NIN - Ghosts](http://ghosts.nin.com/main/home)

> Nine Inch Nails presents Ghosts I - IV, a brand new 36 track instrumental collection available right now. Almost two hours of new music composed and recorded over an intense ten week period last fall, Ghosts I - IV sprawls Nine Inch Nails across a variety of new terrain.

New Nine Inch Nails album announced today. I'm a little annoyed that I didn't get an email, since I am signed up for the mailing list. Luckily, [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/362908/trent-reznor-releases-nine-out-of-thirty+six-tracks-on-free-download) and [Techdirt](http://techdirt.com/articles/20080302/234646401.shtml) let me know. This is pretty cool. He's releasing the first nine tracks as free downloads. $5 gets you all 36 downloads, DRM-free. $10 gets you the downloads now, and the cds when they're released April 1. There are two other options at $75 and $300 that I'm probably not interested in. I'm sure the recording industry is watching this carefully. If this works for Nine Inch Nails, others will try similar things. Radiohead's "pay what you want" experiment worked well, I think. It reinforces the idea that people are not opposed to paying for music from bands they like. We just don't like to be treated as criminals just for listening to music. Anyway, I encourage you to download the free tracks. If you don't like them, no loss. If you do, buy the rest. Think of it as listening to a few tracks at a friend's house to see if you like the band, and then getting the cd when you find out that the band is awesome. Except in this case, your "friend" is Trent Reznor, and his "house" is [NIN.com](http://www.nin.com).
