Crying is acceptable for men in certain situations. Certainly during [Field of Dreams](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097351/). Insulting a man for crying when Kevin Costner plays catch with his dad is actually a valid legal defense for murder in 29 states. But what about spilling a beer? I maintain that if that said beer is a [Bell's Two Hearted](http://www.bellsbeer.com/index.php/brands.html), and if it's Sunday after 8pm so you can't buy any more, crying is totally acceptable. The wife disagrees, but _it wasn't her beer_. Fortunately, I didn't spill it. I told her I almost did, and that I would have cried. She said she would have called me the "P" word. I'm not sure where to draw the line, though. If it were just a regular ale? What if it had spilled on my computer (Which it probably would have)? What if it were my work computer? Does the amount of beer (1/3 bottle, in this case) make a difference? How many left in the house (At that point just one more with my name on it)?
