I probably should have guessed that I wouldn't be the only one downloading Ubuntu 7.10 the day it came out.  Maybe it will actually work tonight.

And next weekend, I'm going to put Ubuntu on my dad's old Windows 98 box.  That should be interesting.  I'm thinking about trying Xubuntu, the lightweight version that requires almost nothing in terms of processor and RAM.  Wouldn't it be nice if Microsoft and Apple had an OS that ran on 128 megs of RAM and 1.5 gigs of hard drive space?

I guess that would keep you from upgrading, though, wouldn't it?
