A coworker brought in two giant bags of candy. Apparently he didn't get as many trick-or-treaters as expected.

What makes it worse is that it's good candy - Heath bars, Butterfingers, M&Ms;, Nerds . . . I'm going to need to jog home for the next week, I think.

So, both a complaint, and an anti-complaint.Â  Because candy is awesome, but thousands of extra calories from fat are not.
