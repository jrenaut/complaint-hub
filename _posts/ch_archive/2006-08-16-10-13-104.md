[CNN.com - Boy, 12, evades security clampdown - Aug 16, 2006](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/08/16/uk.terror.boy/index.html?section=cnn_topstories)

> LONDON, England -- Despite a high level of alert at British airports, a 12-year-old boy managed to board a plane at Gatwick without a passport, ticket or boarding pass.

The important question, though is, "Was he carrying any liquids or an iPod?" Seriously, why do we have security at the airport if it's not meaningful? Are they really just trying to collect nail clippers and screwdrivers to sell on eBay?

Edit: Again, I say something, and [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/16/would_a_hairgel_bomb.html) backs it up.  The letter they link to, from a chemisty grad student, is pretty funny.  And makes our security measures look pretty ridiculous.
