You'd think being ordered to sit around the house and do nothing would be great, but it sure sucks. The bright side of the surgery is that I haven't had any pain to speak of, at least not yet. It's uncomfortable, but not really painful. Haven't touched the drugs yet. The downside is that, despite having work to do, I'm already bored out of my mind. I've made progress with the report I'm working on for my real job, but it's not interesting work, and it's hard to stay focused.
