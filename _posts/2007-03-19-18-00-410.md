Ever gone in the back entrance of the zoo? The one off Adams Mill and Harvard, not Connecticut. If you haven't, you probably have no idea that every single path in the zoo going from east to west is uphill. Every one.

I found that out the hard way, it turns out. Went out for a run, decided to go through the zoo and see if I liked that route.

I don't.

Actually, it wasn't too bad. It was about a 45 minute round-trip from Columbia Heights through Mount Pleasant through the zoo, past Woodley Park Metro, back through Adam's Morgan, and home. 

Now it's starting to rain, and of course I have to move my car. It's a few blocks away, furthest away I've had to park since we moved here.

I'll wait until 6:30 when both sides of the street are open for parking. Meanwhile, I'm going to get out a pen and paper and try and figure out how I managed to run for 40 minutes, return to my original destination, and never go downhill. By my calculations, I should be about thirty feet above the roof of the house.
