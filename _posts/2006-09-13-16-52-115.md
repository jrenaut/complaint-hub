Nothing I read seems to inspire me to post since I got back.  I'm reading the same amount of junk online, but nothing catches my eye, saying, "Hey, jerk, blog about me".  Nothing at all.  It can't be that I'm tired of complaining, because that certainly isn't true.  And it can't be that nothing stupid is happening in the world, because that isn't true, either.  I'm not still jet-lagged, since it's been a week.

So I can't explain my lack of posting.  I can just apologize to my legions of fans, and pledge to try and get inspired again soon.
