I walked over to the grocery store to get a sandwich for lunch a little while ago, and because the person who designed the parking lots around here forgot that some people actually walk places, I had to maneuver my way through parked cars to get to the store.

I passed a Toyota Prius and thought, "Hey, look, an environmentally responsible mode of transportation!"  Seriously.  I thought that.

Then I noticed the cup holder.  Bottled water!  Bottled water is bad.  I forget the exact numbers, but I think it takes 300,000 gallons of water to make one 20-ounce bottled water.  It might be 400,000, or maybe a billion.

Anyway, the point is that bottled water should be your last resort, when you're away from home and really thirsty and pass by a 7-11.  Otherwise, go buy a water filter and a thermos and carry it with you.

Really, you should try it.  You get to look at people drinking bottled water and be all smug.  It's fun.  I mean, what's the point of saving the world if you can't be smug about it to the enviro-heathens?  But don't be a jerk about it.  Smugness is best kept to yourself.
