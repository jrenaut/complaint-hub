[![Our front door](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/135/370996034_ca6db2d701_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/370996034/)The wife and I are now proud owners (Pending closing in a few weeks) of a new condo in Columbia Heights.  We have the first floor.  It's absolutely gorgeous.  I'll have more pictures next time we're able to get inside.  We're obviously very excited.  Columbia Heights is a late-transitional neighborhood, new stuff going in all the time.  It's walking distance (If you really want to) to Dupont Circle and the zoo.  We can walk to the trendy U Street Corridor.  It's going to be awesome.
