Just as he pronounced himself, "ready to pitch in the majors again", [the Braves released Tom Glavine](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4228623). Now, I understand that this is their right, and the guy is 43 years old. But he won 20 games for the Braves five times. For the vast majority of baseball fans today, it doesn't get much more "Braves" than Tom Glavine. I don't know if there was a good reason for doing it this way - waiting until he worked his way back into shape doing rehab in the minors - but it sure comes across to the fans as a terrible way to treat a guy who has been really important to your franchise since **1987**, save the few years he spent as a Met. I'd love to see him come to Baltimore. Or Washington - I'd definitely find a babysitter for an evening if I could go see Glavine pitch. As an aside, some awesomeness from the article:

> Glavine described himself as "very surprised" in a text message to The Associated Press.

The idea of a 43 year old man texting the AP is almost surreal. I hope he used an emoticon or two.
