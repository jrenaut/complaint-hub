Who knew the best Indian food I've ever had would be from a strip mall in Falls Church?  We took my grandmother last night as a Christmas present.  She's very hard to shop for - she pretty much has everything she'll ever need.  So we figured food and company would be better than things she doesn't really have much use for.  And the food was worth the slight wrong turn I took in getting from her house to the restaurant.

Anyway, I highly recommend the place.  They have a location in Bethesda, too, though I've never been.
