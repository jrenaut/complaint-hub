[ESPNsoccernet - World Cup - Zidane sent off in extra time for head butt](http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=373588&cc=5901)

Throughout the World Cup this year, France's Zinedine Zidane has been fantastic. Not only has he played very well, but he's been classy - When he scores, which he does a lot, he acts like he's done it before.

And then he headbutted a defender. It looked like the two of them had some words, and then he headbutted him in the chest. So, as he's already announced his retirement, the last time he left the field, ever, was on a red card when his team really needed him. When that happened, I totally lost interest in the game. I had been rooting for France - Zidane and Henry have been fun to watch, and I've never been a big fan of Italy, not since Roberto Baggio's awful PK miss against Brazil in 1994. But when Zidane left the field, due to nothing but his own inability to control himself, I just stopped caring about the outcome.

It's too bad he's retiring - it would be nice to see a big long suspension for him.
