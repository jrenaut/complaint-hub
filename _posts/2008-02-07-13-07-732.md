> Researchers have found a correlation between drinking diet soda and metabolic syndrome — the collection of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes that include abdominal obesity, high cholesterol and blood glucose levels — and elevated blood pressure.

I hate diet soda. Not only does it taste terrible, but it's really bad for you. I've cut out most of the soda from my diet. And the less I drink, the less I enjoy it. So I guess that's good. But I always drink the regular stuff. I'd rather high-fructose corn syrup than some carcinogenic artificial sweetener.
