I was reading [this article](http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=247109&_QSBPA=Y&pgid=etfarticle) about the failure of some [ETFs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund) to really commit to their theme. He talks about some ETFs that claim to be based on wind power but have holdings like BP that really don't depend on the success of wind power at all. The most interesting part of the article, though, wasn't really his point. It was an ETF called [PowerShares Global Wind Energy Portfolio](http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=PWND). For some of you their ticker symbol, PWND, means nothing. For others, it has a [rich and humorous meaning](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pwn3d). In any event, I was looking at the Google Finance page for the fund, and saw the a [discussion thread](http://finance.google.com/group/google.finance.291319/browse_thread/thread/4132c6e788d58e85) that caught my eye. I don't know why these things make me laugh so much, but they do, and this did. I guess I'm just a sucker for dumb internet memes that won't go away.
