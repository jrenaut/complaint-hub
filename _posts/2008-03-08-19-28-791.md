i swear i never got very sore after flag football games until this season.&nbsp_place_holder; there have always been bruises, abrasions, the occasional ruptured achilles tendon & what have you, but generally little (if any) muscle soreness.&nbsp_place_holder; i know i'm not going as hard as i used to when i block...that's fine...that explains the decrease in bumps and bruises. but i essentially do the same general 'staying fit' workouts as i did during past seasons. i would think there shouldn't be a marked increase in muscle-soreness.&nbsp_place_holder; the only explanation i can think of is i'm getting old.&nbsp_place_holder; and it sucks.&nbsp_place_holder; well worth testing the complaint submission form.&nbsp_place_holder;
