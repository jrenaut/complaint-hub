Anyone who's met Biscuit would probably tell you she's crazy, but most of them don't even know one of her strange little eccentricities.  On the advice of a [friend](http://hedgeshaman.blogspot.com/), known by many as a "cat whisperer", I take Bis' food away in the morning, and refill her dish in the evening.  This, somehow, makes her less likely to be a noisy pain in the butt at three AM.  Now, Biscuit is always very vocal and excited when dinner time rolls around.  Makes sense.  Most living things enjoy eating.  But Biscuit is similarly excited in the morning when I take away her food and refill her water bowl.  I don't understand it.
