[![Camden Yards](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2196/2525690937_d9202752d1_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/2525690937/)The Orioles climbed out last place yesterday with a [win over the Yankees](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280526101). The wife and I went with two other couples. I had almost forgotten how much I like the stadium in Baltimore. The new Nationals Park is nice, but it's no Camden Yards. I suppose that may be because the Orioles are my team, and I'd love their park no matter what. Anyway, it's kind of depressing to go to a game there these days. Thanks to Peter Angelos and his commitment to pretending to want to win, attendance at Camden Yards is pretty sad. There were more Yankees fans than Orioles fans (Although most of the Yankees fans left after the Orioles went up 6-0 in the seventh). I've never been to a sporting event where the visiting fans were so overpowering. There were Yankees chants that Orioles fans mostly ignored. I guess it's hard to yell back when you're outnumbered. The win was nice. [Garrett Olson](http://www.baseball-reference.com/o/olsonga01.shtml) was pretty dominant in seven shutout innings. [Nick Markakis](http://www.baseball-reference.com/m/markani01.shtml) had three hits, two runs, and two RBIs. And aside from [Matsui](http://www.baseball-reference.com/m/matsuhi01.shtml) and his three hits, the Yankees were pretty pathetic on offense. And we saw a drunk woman in a Jeter shirt get escorted out by security. We saw an Orioles fan [propose to his girlfriend](http://flickr.com/photos/thetejon/2526492230/) (She said yes). And the weather was beautiful. Now all we need to do is a few more wins to put some distance between us and the bottom of the division.
