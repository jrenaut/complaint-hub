A summary of the race is up at [Washington Running Report](http://www.runwashington.com/news/mar08stpatrick8krpt.html). The two high school kids who ran in shorts and no shirts passed me about a mile in - I was pretty sure they were insane then, and I remain convinced of it now. The results have been updated - 41:07 was my clock time, but 40:38 was my actual chip time. That is, from the time they said, "Go" until the time I crossed the finish was 41:07. But the from the time I crossed the starting line until the time I crossed the finish was 40:38. Crap. Now I have to run another one and get under 40 minutes.
