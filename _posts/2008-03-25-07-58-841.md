[New South Park site debuts, with full episode streaming - Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/24/new-south-park-site.html)

> Eventually every episode and clip will be available everywhere in the world. There is a tangle of contracts that Comedy Central has with different cable companies and territories that are preventing us from that right now. But hopefully it won't be long.

This brings me back to the glory days Chuckles. Chuckles was the name of the forgotten machine on the work network that the IT team didn't realize was unused. It had every episode of South Park through season 8, gigs of MP3s, movies, and tv shows. Whenever I was bored at work, I could just watch something. And now the creators of South Park are doing the same thing. Shocking that the show that has never been afraid of pushing the envelope (BTW, did you know that "pushing the envelope" actually refers to the [flight envelope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushing_the_envelope), which is "the capabilities of [an airplane] design in terms of speed and altitude"?) is also not afraid of experimenting with new business models.
