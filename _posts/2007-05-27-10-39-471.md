As many of you may have, I saw [Ani's Raw Food Kitchen](http://www.aniphyo.com/) on [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net) the other day. Yesterday morning, we tried her recipe for a Spanish Breakfast Scramble.

I've never really tried raw vegan cooking. I mean, I'm certainly not going to start eating vegan exclusively, but that doesn't mean I can't learn anything from the diet. 

Now, before I go any further, let me just make it clear that the wife cooked all this, not me. I just found the website. Well, BoingBoing found the website. Anyway.

So, we tried it yesterday, and it was quite good. "It was better than I thought it was going to be," says the wife. I concur. 

The fact that you have to watch the video on her website to learn how to prepare the meal is a pretty annoying way of encouraging you to buy her book, but I suppose I understand. As a result of this, I've done some quick Googling for other raw vegan recipes. Much of what I've found is buried in self-righteous crap - "Oh, you aren't a raw vegan? You probably kick puppies too." But I'll keep looking.
