Whenever I see the traffic to [this page](/blog/is-wikimetro-a-scam) and [this page](/blog/wikimetro-says-were-totally-not-a-scam) quadruple, I know that Wikimetro has sent out another batch of spam to various bloggers, pitching their scam. If Wikimetro contacts you, ignore them. Or, better yet, file a complaint. I was thinking of complaining [here](http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx), but never got around to it. I don't think the FBI appreciates online scams very much.
