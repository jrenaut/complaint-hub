[Electronic poll books in Tuesday test](http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8KGL7181.htm)

> State election officials and the manufacturer of the machines, Diebold Inc., will conduct the test from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. at the BWI Airport Marriott Hotel.

Any of you in Maryland anywhere near BWI should go take part in this test today.  I suggest reading up on how to hack a Diebold machine so you can try and do it while you're voting.  Anyone who reads [Techdirt](http://www.techdirt.com) (Or, for that matter, anyone paying attention to any election in the last few years) knows that Diebold has made a lot of machines that don't work very well, has been extremely resistant to allowing any kind of testing, and has ignored repeated assertions that the machines are insecure.

To all of you who find a Diebold machine in front of you on election day - refuse to vote on it.  If we make enough noise, maybe we can actually have an election that is efficient, accurate, and verifiable.  Note well, though, that I can not be held responsible if you protest too loudly and are arrested.  That's all you.
