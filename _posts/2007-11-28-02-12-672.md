[Nanowrimo](http://www.nanowrimo.org) is quickly approaching its end.  And so is my novel.  The story is done, really.  I'm currently writing a completely gratuitous bar scene, where a nerdy-but-recently-famous blogger is being hit on by a beautiful-but-gold-digging girl.  It has nothing to do with advancing the plot, but it's doing nicely to advance the word count.  I have about 2,800 words to go, and I expect to finish Thursday.  Tomorrow I'm going out, so I don't think I can get that many words in.  But Thursday I have no plans.  Except probably watch "The Office".  But I can do 2,800 words.

I'm debating whether to share the story when I'm done.  I was thinking of putting up a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) licensed text file and letting people do what they want.  I don't think I'll ever do anything more with the story. But maybe I should let the wife read it first, and make sure it's okay to share.  I don't think it's very good.  It's maybe a better story than last year's, but not as good as 2002, 2003, or 2005.  And my 2005 story was about talking ducks and, squirrel concubines, and evil foxes.  So that may put this one in perspective.

I probably need to rethink my approach for Nano 2008.  My stories are getting worse.  I don't think that's really the intention.
