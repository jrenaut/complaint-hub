Those of you who use [Google Finance](http://finance.google.com/finance) to track the implosion of your stock portfolio have probably noticed that they've moved the graph that tracks the Dow and the S&P; over to make room for a big box of ads. I'm curious why they did that. Not only does it look a little out of place, but do people really go to Google Finance looking to buy something? If they offered a cheap way to buy stock, I could understand that. But the ad it's showing me now is "Free Grants for Finances", whatever that means. It doesn't seem to really fit in with their typical strategy of unobtrusive, targeted ads. I suppose it doesn't cost them anything, and could bring in plenty of money, but it could also backfire by annoying long-time users like me by taking up a pretty large chunk of prime screen real estate. I hope they don't make any money off the ads and decide to remove them.
