I was in Maryland today visiting some good friends, and got home around 11:30PM to find the street one block over closed by police cars and crime scene tape. I'm not feeling terribly inclined to go investigate, but I'm curious what it is. I suppose I'll have to find out in the morning.

Update:  I hear from a Columbia Heights message board that our councilmember, Jim Graham, sent an email out. There was a shooting, one dead, one wounded.
