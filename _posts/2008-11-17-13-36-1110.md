What a disappointing game. Fantastic seats, though. The picture from my phone kind of sucks, but I didn't feel like bringing the cool camera and I forgot to steal the wife's point and shoot. Have you ever been to FedEx Field to watch the Redskins? It is the worst stadium I've ever been to in terms of getting home. There don't seem to be signs to get back to the Metro (Probably because it's a mile away) and getting out of the parking lot takes hours. I met my friend at New Carrollton because he was coming from Annapolis, and I rode with him to the parking lot. On the way out, he was going to drop me off at the Metro again, but I had to leave him and walk. When I got to the Morgan Boulevard station, he still hadn't moved from his spot, and I caught the second to last train of the night. It's too bad, because I like the stadium, but I'm not sure they could have made it less accessible.
