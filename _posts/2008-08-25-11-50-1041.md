[Unshelved](http://www.unshelved.com/blog.aspx?post=1140) points us to a [story](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-ap-mi-librarydiaries,0,6451431.story) about a librarian getting fired for writing a book about library patrons. Since the book is easy to find on Amazon, I have to think that her sales are going to go up based on the loss of her job.
