I tweaked my strategy to import this blog into [Drupal](http:/www.drupal.org), and it's working quite well on my local machine.  I had wanted to go with the brand new Drupal 6.0, but it's not quite finished, and many of the modules that I might want to use haven't been updated yet.  So I think I'll go with 5.7, and then upgrade down the road a little when 6.0 is more mature.

My big problem is the permalinks.  I don't want to have to write individual .htaccess entries for 700-some posts - I can't imagine that's a good idea.  So I need a redirect rule, and I don't know much about writing them.  I think I can figure it out, though.  I think I'm going to have to map http://www.blog.complainthub.com/?p=123 to http://www.complainthub.com/node/123 or something like that.  I don't think that will be hard, but you never know.  Luckily my webhost uses nice, sensible [Apache](http://www.apache.org) servers, instead of some [hideous abomination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services).

Anyway, my next challenge will be scraping together a new theme.  I have some ideas, but I need to execute them.  And I need to pick a color scheme.  You can leave suggestions in the comments, which I'll probably ignore.  But you can leave them.
