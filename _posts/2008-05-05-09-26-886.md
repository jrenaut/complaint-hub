[ESPN - Papa John's to offer Cleveland residents 23-cent pizzas](http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3381471)

> Papa John's Pizza issued an apology to Cleveland and the Cavaliers for making T-shirts with LeBron James' number and the word "crybaby" under it.

Who's the marketing person in Washington who decided this would be a good idea? I suppose I could probably find him or her by doing a resume search on Careerbuilder for marketing resumes added in the last two days. Since I've watched more basketball this year than any other year in my lifetime because of the Celtics-fan wife, I have a better idea of what a hard foul is than I used to. And the little montage ESPN put together of the Wizards pounding on LeBron was pretty ridiculous. So I don't blame him for complaining a bit. And I doubt he's crying now, as he's headed to Boston on Tuesday while Brendan Heywood is headed to play golf.
