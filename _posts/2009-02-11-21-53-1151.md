The Nationals [signed Adam Dunn](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3900143)! I'm so excited that there will actually be a player on the home team that I want to see. Usually I go to games to see the visiting team, but this year will be different. I mean, I'm still mostly looking forward to [finally seeing Albert Pujols](/node/928) and maybe getting tickets when the Orioles come to town. But watching Dunn will be pretty cool.
