[This Washington Post article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/03/AR2009080302815.html?hpid=artslot) has been [pissing](http://newcolumbiaheights.blogspot.com/2009/08/post-article-on-columbia-heights-target.html) [off](http://www.theheightslifedc.com/2009/08/another-word-on-todays-wapo-article.html) [tons](http://www.princeofpetworth.com/2009/08/i-dont-really-get-this-article-but-having-read-it-i-now-feel-nauseous/) [of locals](http://dcist.com/2009/08/the_washington_post_on_hipsters_and.php). It basically says that everyone in Columbia Heights sucks, we spend all our time at Target, and we're smug because we don't live in Mount Pleasant. I've been wanting to post something about it, but no matter how many times I read the article, I just can't seem to get that worked up over it. I mean, I _do_ go to Target a lot. I _like_ Target. It's a great place to buy cheap clothes for the kid, kitty litter, veggie burgers, box wine . . . But I guess the article doesn't quite hit that close to home. I have been accused of being smug about where I live, but that was in relation to Ballston. I'm glad I don't live in Ballston - not that it's a bad place to live, it's just not what we were looking for. And Mount Pleasant? I like Mount Pleasant. When we outgrow our place, that's probably the first place we're going to look. And Wonderland references are lost on me - I've been maybe a half dozen times, it's a cool bar, but it's not my hangout. We're much more likely to sit out on the porch at Commonwealth and drink Twisted Thistles and order a cheese plate. The article was a little annoying, I admit. It took a small group of Columbia Heights residents and made sweeping generalizations about everyone here. It didn't really offer any insight, and I don't think it got the generalizations right. But I just don't care. If the article had been about the roads around Target, that would have been a different story - whoever thought the traffic patterns around DCUSA could hold up to the volume of cars and pedestrians there are now was totally insane.
