[McCain Sees Pork Where Scientists See Success - washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/09/AR2008030902152.html?nav=rss_email/components)

> "Approach a bear: 'That bear cub over there claims you are his father, and we need to take your DNA.' Approach another bear: 'Two hikers had their food stolen by a bear, and we think it is you. We have to get the DNA.' The DNA doesn't fit, you got to acquit, if I might."

The title of the article on the Post RSS feed is better - "McCain Criticizes Bear Study". Of course he does! None of the bears even had degrees! Anyway, I think he's upset that we spent the equivalent of the budget for 48 seconds of the Iraq war on something that didn't involve shooting at or otherwise endangering Muslims. Was that a cheap shot? Oops. Honestly, I do not understand the planet that John McCain lives on. I don't know how rational human beings can listen to him and think, "Yeah, okay, President McCain, that would be cool".
