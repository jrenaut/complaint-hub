[Boing Boing: Have sex on a plane at 10,000 feet for under $300](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/09/10/have_sex_on_a_plane_.html)

This seems like cheating, though.  I mean, isn't most of the allure of sex on a plane the fact that you're doing it more or less in public?  Maybe not.  Not sure the wife would be up for it in any event.
