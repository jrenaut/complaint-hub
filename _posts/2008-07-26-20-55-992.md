[Yahoo! Music Store Will Compensate Customers For DRM-ed Music](http://gizmodo.com/5029606/yahoo-music-store-will-compensate-customers-for-drm+ed-music) Looks like maybe Yahoo will make it right for people who thought they were [actually buying songs](http://www.complainthub.com/blog/where-microsoft-went-yahoo-will-follow), rather than renting. Good for Yahoo. I hope the "compensation" details are actually consumer-friendly.
