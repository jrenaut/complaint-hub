I've been working on some [Ajax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) hotness for you on the [complaint submission form](http://www.submissions.complainthub.com), and it looks pretty cool in [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com).  However, not long ago, Windows XP insisted that I upgrade to Internet Explorer 7, where they added some features that other browsers have had for years and moved everything you've always used to strange places so you can't find anything.

So, the cool Ajax, courtesy of [Scriptaculous](http://script.aculo.us), doesn't work at all in IE7.  I'm still working on it, though.

For any of you coming here using Internet Explorer, please do yourself and the rest of the world a favor and download a real browser.  I prefer Firefox, but anything is better than IE.
