Go to [Google](http://www.google.com) and type in "mccain nude" without the quotes. You'll see that, as of today, [this](taxonomy/term/166) is the very first hit. You may ask how I know this. No, I was not searching for nude pictures of John McCain, or of anyone else. But someone else may have been, because someone found my site with that Google search. I'm only sixth when you search for "mccain hates bears" without the quotes, but first if you include them. I'm first for "nude mccain hates bears". Anyway, none of this is really that important, but it's amusing.
