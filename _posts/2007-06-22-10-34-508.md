We were at [RFD](http://www.lovethebeer.com/rfd.html) last night, and I couldn't resist the Dogfish Head Raison D'Extra. I probably _should_ have resisted, but I didn't. Now I'm paying for it.

Anyway, the beer is 18% alcohol. It cost $19.95 for a 12 ounce bottle. And it's pretty good. It's not something I would drink very often. It's very sweet, a little bit in the wine direction but not too far.

And I was thinking - with that much alcohol, drinking one of those is more or less like drinking a six pack of Miller Lite.  Except you can be much more smug about it.

The waiter almost got his arm ripped off, though.  He actually tried to take the glass when there was still a swallow left.  Ordinarily, I probably would have let him go.  But that was like $4 worth of beer left.  So I punched him in the face.

Not really.  But you get the idea.
