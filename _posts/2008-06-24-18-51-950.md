[![imgp1165](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3092/2608229455_9b939a0498_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/2608229455/)Another game, another loss. [Lackey](http://www.baseball-reference.com/l/lackejo01.shtml) was highly effective if not impressive to watch. [Jay Bergmann](http://www.baseball-reference.com/b/bergmja01.shtml), a nice example of why record is a crummy indicator of pitching success, matched him most of the game. Unfortunately for the Nats, [Willie Harris](http://www.baseball-reference.com/h/harriwi02.shtml) provided the entirety of their offense, and the defense deserted them in the top of the eighth. Our new seats were okay. I don't really like having to walk indoors through the air conditioning to get to our seats. It just seems wrong. And there was a really obnoxious guy sitting just behind us. He appears to have season tickets, since my boss recognized my description of the guy. But they're comfortable (Padded seats! At a baseball game!) and it's a good view. So I guess I can't complain. And they played the game this time. Two straight rainouts would have been tough to take.
