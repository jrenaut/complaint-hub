I had [ my bunion removed](/node/896) this morning. Right now, I'm sitting on the couch with my foot up, wondering how much it's going to hurt as the anesthetic wears off. They told me it would be six to eight hours, and the surgery was eight hours ago. Right now I mostly just feel pressure. They wrapped it pretty tight. If it hurts, I have some great drugs, so I should be fine. But I'd rather not have to use them. I guess we'll see. If you are looking to have surgery, I highly recommend the [Center for Ambulatory Surgery](http://casi.medstar.net/) at 19th and L NW. From beginning to end, everyone was friendly, helpful, and professional. I can't speak to the results yet, but so far so good. Too bad it's the All Star break - this would be a great time to watch some baseball.
