[CNN.com - UK, Arnie in global warming pact - Aug 1, 2006](http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/01/blair.arnie.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories) First Nick Saban, now the Governator?  Ahnold has now bypassed the President and gone straight to Tony Blair to make an agreement on global warming.  Everyone wants to distance themselves from an unpopular President. 

> "We see that there is not great leadership from the federal government when it comes to protecting the environment," Schwarzenegger said. "We know there is global warming, so we should stop it."

Great.  Stop global warming.  I'm all in favor of being more environmentally friendly.  But this reeks of "Please re-elect me, California" rather than any sort of real step toward anything.

And no matter how much I dislike the President, we can't let being publically rude to him become a tool to win voters.  It's like focusing on his poor public speaking - it ignores the real problems (Like his desire to take away all of our civil rights) and focuses on something highly visible, but not that important.
