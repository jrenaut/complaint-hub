I'm at work today, despite the fact that it's Presidents' Day.  Or is it President's Day?  A day for all the Presidents?  Or a day for the office of President?  I don't know.  But all you should know that, if "Presidents' Day" is wrong, it means I got the the name wrong.  It's not a grammatical error.

In any event, the point is that no one is here.  More importantly, Caribou Coffee is not opening until 8AM.  That's 15 minutes from now.  I know it opens at 8AM because I just walked down there in the cold to find them closed.  I'm so mad I briefly considered not going back after 8.  That's how mad I am.
