As I near the internet geek abyss, posting to my blog using [Flock](http://www.flock.com) on a box running [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com), setting up an account at [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/), spending the afternoon learning about [apt-get](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apt-get), I realize that I'm enjoying myself.  My fiancee thinks I'm crazy, but that's nothing new.

I haven't cut the cord to Windows yet, although I'd like to.  I'll probably keep my laptop dual-booting (Currently it's XP only) just in case.

On a related note, speaking of fiancees, I'm wondering how I can convince her that a new monitor is a reasonable investment.  I'm currently using a 17" CRT from 1998 when I'm not on my laptop, and it's pretty painful.  It was cruel of them at work to buy me a 24" widescreen, because now everything else seems like an insult to my eyes.  It'll probably have to wait until after the wedding, though.
