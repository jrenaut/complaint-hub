[![Sad in the rain](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1031/808259072_78adf6a94f_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/808259072/)At the wife's request, I did not take the bus this morning. She might not have made the request if she had, as I did, gone outside to take out the trash. If she had taken out the trash, she probably would have decided that it was raining too hard, and that we should take the bus. But she didn't take out the trash, so we walked. For those of you not in or near DC, it's been raining for a while now, and things are starting to flood. Not serious floods, but minor property damage and hydroplaning cars kind of floods. So, we bundled work clothes and lunch and whatnot into bags, put on our raincoats, and set off. It wasn't as bad as I had feared. There weren't that many people walking, so there weren't too many umbrellas to avoid. Umbrellas and puddles are the scourge of the city rain walker. Especially those giant golf umbrellas that take up the entire sidewalk. So I arrived at work, slightly damp but okay otherwise. I changed my clothes, and realized that my backpack is not entirely waterproof. The two things that got wet - my laptop power supply (Although not badly - I wiped it off and it's fine) and my brown socks. So now I'm wearing brown slacks, brown shoes, a brown belt, and little white athletic socks. Oops. Perhaps the brown socks will dry, or perhaps I will just wear these all day. Only time will tell.
