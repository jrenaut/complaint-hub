[Welcome - Ubuntu: Linux for human beings](http://www.ubuntu.com/)

Just saw on [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com) that Ubuntu has released a new version, which contains, among other things, Firefox 2.0. Sweet. Can't wait to get home and upgrade my Ubuntu box.

Edit: Ooh, maybe I should have waited. Upgrade crapped out, now I'm not sure whether it's going to boot back up. We'll see how long it takes me to get a good install again.  Ubuntu forum users report some problems, which I guess is to be expected.  But I was so close to getting my Complaint Hub enhancements working, and now my development box is hosed. . .
