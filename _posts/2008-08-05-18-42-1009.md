It seems a TSA contractor has [misplaced an unencrypted laptop full of people's personal information]()

> The Transportation Security Administration suspended Verified Identity Pass Inc., the company that operates the registered traveler program under the brand name Clear, from enrolling new applicants due to the alleged theft of the unencrypted laptop.

Link from [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/08/05/laptop-with-data-abo.html), but they kind of dropped the ball by not mentioning the unencrypted status of the missing laptop. Luckily one of the comments mentioned it. Keep in mind this is entirely against TSA regulations (I worked there for 9 months). TSA is colossally stupid sometimes, like when they made me take my unencrypted (before the regulation went into effect) laptop home on the Metro every day for a week rather than leaving it in the secure facility where I worked. But I'm almost inclined to not blame them for the actions of a contractor. 

> TSA officials said the suspension will protect consumers waiting to enroll in the Clear program and allow the company to bring its procedures into compliance.

How about making them give back all the money due to breach of contract? There's no accountability in government contracting.
