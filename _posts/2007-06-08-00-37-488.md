In June, I have 30 hits from people who have Googled "hotmoms" and found [this post](http://www.blog.complainthub.com/?p=404). Okay, fine, I know people look on the internet for porn. NB: There is no porn here. There is plenty of porn on the internet, and I don't feel the need to contribute any more.

_Edit: I can't believe no one caught that I wrote "don't feel the need to contribute anymore" instead of "any more". I certainly am not claiming to have previously contributed to the vast collection of porn on the internet. I guess my mom and my wife must not have read this post yet.Â  Both of them would have caught that. _

Anyway, what I find strange is that Google Analytics tells me that, of those 30 visits, two are RETURN visits. Now, I suppose it's possible that the two returning visits are people who have otherwise seen the site, happened to be searching for "hotmoms", and decided to see what Complaint Hub had to offer on the subject.

But I prefer to speculate wildly and assume that two people have searched for "hotmoms", found my site, and then searched for it again and returned. I'm sure they were disappointed both times.
