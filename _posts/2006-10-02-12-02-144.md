So, there was some confusion as to whether or not the state of Maryland was going to accept our marriage license after we missed the deadline (five days after the wedding) by almost exactly a month.  Oops.  I called the license department this morning, and they said they didn't have the license, which was sort of troubling.  After a quick consultation with the wife, who obtained a tracking number from her dad (the wedding officiant), I called back.  This time they found it, and everything is official.  So we don't have to get our wedding bands re-engraved with a new date.  That's a plus.
