Some may not know the 2005 Selbach Riesling Dry, but [this guy](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/food/301725_winepick31.html) does. 

> Riesling is one of the noblest of all grapes, capable of creating wines of the highest quality and in the widest range of styles.

I'd have to agree. I've always found them to be quite noble. 

> The 2005 Selbach Riesling is a straightforward, virtually dry version with bright and fresh fruit flavors reminiscent of apples and melons.

I'm not sure why, in a 300 word review, he only dedicates two sentences to the wine he's making his Pick of the Week. But whatever. Then we have [this guy](http://grapemashstash.blogspot.com/2006/04/selbach-dry-riesling-2004.html), who says of the 2004 vintage: 

> This pale, straw yellow wine is wonderfully refreshing, crisp, and clean. Aromas of apple and citrus are mellow, but the tart flavors of green, Granny Smith-type apples and lemon, explode in your mouth.

And [some say](http://www.vinotrip.com/2008/05/07/wbw-45-old-world-riesling/) the wine is "weak and violently acidic". Saying it in comic strip form gives it that je ne sais quoi so often lacking in snarky wine reviews. But what happens, you might ask, when you crack a bottle of the 2005 Selbach Riesling Dry, drink a little bit, and then leave it in the fridge, the cork shoved back in, for an entire month? I'm here to answer that question. I have to say that it holds up all right. I'm not a really knowledgeable wine guy. I love my 2004 Gibson Wilfreda, and if I see a Rosemount Shiraz for under $10 at the grocery store, I'm all over it. But I don't drink a lot of white wine. This month-old Riesling is still quite pleasant, though. I think it might not be as crisp as it once was, but it pairs well with [Mexican veggie burgers](http://www.theveggietable.com/recipes/mexicanveggieburgers.html) and Law and Order reruns. So, if you're like me, and you have an old bottle of this, half open in the fridge, and it's just bugging you every time you open the fridge, don't pour it out. Have a glass. You won't regret it.
