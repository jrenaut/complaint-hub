Okay, maybe "tragedy" is a bit of an exaggeration. But first poor [Brandon Fahey](http://www.baseball-reference.com/f/faheybr01.shtml), despite getting his slash stats up to .241/.267/.345, has been sent to Norfolk, the O's AAA affiliate. And then [George "Captain Overrated" Sherrill](http://www.baseball-reference.com/s/sherrge01.shtml) blew another save by loading the bases in the bottom of the ninth and _walking in the winning run_. The Orioles came back from 5-1 in the ninth and he walked in the winning run. It is unconscionable that he was not traded for prospects at the trading deadline. Were I the Orioles GM, I would have taken $30 and a ham sandwich for Sherrill. Actually, were I the Orioles GM, I probably would have had him taken out back and shot a month ago. In any event, the loss of Brandon Fahey pains me more. I was really starting to like the little guy. I don't know why we sent him down. I mean, I do, but I don't like it. It's obvious that [Alex Cintron](http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/cintral01.shtml) and [Juan Castro](http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/castrju01.shtml) are not the future at shortstop. Why even bother with a 36-year-old infielder on a team that is clearly not going to make the playoffs this year? Good luck in Norfolk, Fahey. And come back soon (You could have Sherrill's spot, or [Sarfate's](http://www.baseball-reference.com/s/sarfade01.shtml), if it were up to me).
