The most telling part of this whole post is the final line: "Our biggest enemy isn't the GOP. It's our own inaction."  That's exactly my problem.  Both with everyone else, and with myself.  I complain, and I vote, but that's about it.  I need to find a way to get more involved.

Actually, I think I should run for office.  I'll destroy bi-partisanship and return the government to the people.  Would you vote for me?
