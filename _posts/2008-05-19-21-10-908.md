Via [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/391511/cellphone-use-while-pregnant-causes-kids-to-go-haywire-study-says), a [new study](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/warning-using-a-mobile-phone-while-pregnant-can-seriously-damage-your-baby-830352.html) suggests that cellphone use while pregnant will cause behavioral problems in children. I don't buy this. Partly it's because the article is pretty light on facts. But it doesn't even address the possibility that maybe mothers who spend their lives glued to the cellphone are not giving their kids enough attention, which leads to the behavioral problems. Cellphone use may be the symptom of the cause, but not the cause itself. Maybe the study addresses this point and refutes it, but the article doesn't get into that. And I'm inclined not to believe any of the "OMG excessive use of X leads to horrible result Y!" studies that always focus on some technology that's become common in the last five to ten years and seem to explain away some horrible plague upon our society. Every generation has new technologies, and every generation has new problems. There isn't necessarily a cause and effect relationship here. Anyway, maybe the study gets into all that, but we'll never know. Unless you're one of those weird people who actually research this sort of thing instead of just bitching about it.
