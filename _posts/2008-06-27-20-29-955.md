Just watching a bit of the Orioles-Nationals game. It seems so far that we have Evil [Daniel Cabrera](http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/cabreda01.shtml) rather than Unhittable Daniel Cabrera. He didn't walk a batter in the two run first inning, but just about every ball he threw was hit hard, and only some good anticipation by Brian Roberts to get a double play got them out of the inning only down 2-0. But [Brandon Fahey](http://www.baseball-reference.com/f/faheybr01.shtml). Do you understand what it means to have a career OPS+ of 50? This guy must have photos of the O's GM doing something really, really awful. I know it was time to get rid of Miguel Tejada, but I think I speak for most Orioles fans when I say that we expected you to replace him with a real major league player. Now the bases are loaded for the Nats with two outs in the bottom of the first. I need to go find a bottle of tequila.
