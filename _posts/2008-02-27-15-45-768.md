[Eat Well DC hires new chef | Washington Business Journal](http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2008/02/25/daily19.html)

> Eat Well DC Restaurant Group has hired a new chef to oversee the company's four D.C. restaurants. Branden Levine, who was formerly chef and owner of The Tavern Restaurant in Heathsville, Va., replaces Sal Del Rosario, who was with the company for 18 months.

This is interesting news. I've been to Merkado once, and to The Heights numerous times (How smug are we about being there opening night?). I have no idea what's going to change with a new chef. The food there is good, although I liked what I had at Merkado better than most of what I've had at The Heights. There's something about the food at The Heights that knocks it down a notch. It's not that the food is bad, because it isn't. It just feels like they could tweak some recipes just a little bit and be much better. So, we'll see what happens.
