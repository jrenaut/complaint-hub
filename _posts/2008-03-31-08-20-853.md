[Homemade Seitan recipe](http://www.theppk.com/recipes/dbrecipes/index.php?RecipeID=112) If you're in the same boat as I am, where you don't really eat a lot of meat at home, but when you cook something like a stir-fry, you like to have meat-like lumps of protein. But you also don't like to buy heavily processed meat substitutes. Well, you'll like this recipe. It's really easy to make. The vital wheat gluten flour and nutritional yeast flakes can be tough to find. I got mine from [iHerb.com](http://www.iherb.com/Default.aspx), and you can get them from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com), too. And you must bear in mind that this stuff looks kind of disgusting as it's cooking - you're basically putting a doughy blob into water and simmering it for an hour. It looks like something you'd put out at an elementary school Halloween party, telling kids it's brains. The recipe makes a lot. It instructs you to cut the dough into three pieces before you simmer it, and each one ends up being a pretty good-sized hunk of meat substitute. I made stir-fry with one chunk, and we ate it last night, and both have lunch for today. The other two thirds are still in the fridge. And it's quite good. I'd heard that some vegetarians/vegans won't eat seitan because it's too much like meat. I did not have that reaction to it. It's probably a little more meat-like than typical store-bought extra-firm tofu (I think I have more hyphenated compound words in this post than anything I've ever written), but you aren't going to sneak this in to a dish and fool meat-eaters into thinking it's steak. According to the comments on the recipe, it sounds like you can do a lot of tweaking the recipe for different dishes. Since the seitan soaks up a lot of the broth in which it simmers, I imagine that you could play around with the flavor a lot. And I'm sure we'll try.
