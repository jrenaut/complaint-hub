[BP’s Profits Lag Behind its Oil Peers « Earth2Tech](http://earth2tech.com/2008/02/05/bps-profits-lag-behind-its-oil-peers/)

Well, that sucks. I go to BP whenever possible because of their reputation on environmental issues. Pretty disappointing to see that their competitors, who seem to care very little about the environment, are making record profits again.

_Note: I changed the title of this post from "BP maybe . . ." to "BP may be". I'm not sure that the first choice was actually incorrect, but I do think that this way is better. Your views may differ, and feel free to correct me if you want. I may or may not listen to you._
