[Tcritic - Daily T-Shirt Blog](http://tcritic.com/)

Ever since the dude from [Preshrunk](http://preshrunk.info/) stopped updating regularly, there has been a t-shirt-shaped hole in my RSS reader.  But no more.  Ever since BoingBoing pointed me towards the [list of blogs that I'm not cool enough to be reading already](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/12/04/great_list_of_undera.html), I've added Tcritic to my daily reads.  Awesome t-shirts, not too much commentary (You know how some of us bloggers get long-winded and rambling.  I mean, not me, of course).
