[![We will miss you, Sean](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2233/2083813810_ae7a58fa37_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/2083813810/)The pregame tribute to Sean Taylor was really pretty moving.  Watching the entire stadium waving the #21 towels that they gave out on the way in while they showed a slide show on the scoreboard was pretty intense.

There was a pretty huge ovation, too, when they ran the first defensive play with [only ten players](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3138182).

It's too bad the team couldn't come away with a win, but that was hardly the defense's fault.  Since the margin of victory was less than the safety allowed when the offensive line decided to just ignore everyone while Campbell dropped back in the end zone, and we managed almost no offense against the 31st ranked defense in the NFL.
