> In essence, what they're saying is that food companies don't get a bonus credit for leaving out an excess of salt, sugar or fat, because it's something they should be doing anyway.

I love this post. It reminds me of the Chris Rock skit about the guy bragging that he's never been to jail, that he takes care of his kids. Rock, appropriately, responds, 'You're not supposed to go to jail." If you haven't seen the skit, you should. It's probably on YouTube or something.

What we're looking for is "good faith" healthy food.  That is, not something that's had just enough fat or salt or whatever removed to meet some minimum guideline.  Stuff that's labeled "healthy" should actually have healthy ingredients.  It should have a reasonable amount of sugar (natural sugar, not the cancer-y stuff), minimal fat and sodium, maybe some protein, some whole wheat flour . . .

While it's nice that it's getting easier every day to find stuff labeled "organic" at the grocery store, there's more to it than that.  And most people, myself included, aren't going to go research the company they're buying from and make sure the labels really mean what they imply.

I don't know what the solution is, but I hope someone does.
