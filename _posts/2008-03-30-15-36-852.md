[Marred with a possible drug suspension, Orioles release Gibbons](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/spring2008/news/story?id=3320730)

> Gibbons is owed $5.7 million this year from the Orioles and $6.2 million for 2009.

That must be kind of depressing for [Jay Gibbons](http://www.baseball-reference.com/g/gibboja01.shtml). The Orioles have told him they'd rather just throw away $11 million than have him on their team. I'm not terribly sad to see him go. Even though his picture in MLB 2005 for the Gamecube looks just like [my brother's](http://srenaut.blogspot.com/) friend Jay, he's only managed 500 at bats in a season once. His OPS+ last year was 62. Since 100 is average, it follows that 62 is bad. He's 30, so his durability is unlikely to improve. Still, he was a career Oriole - all his major league at bats are for Baltimore. And you hate to see the guy just dumped so unceremoniously. Oh, well. I'll write about something non-baseball related tomorrow.
