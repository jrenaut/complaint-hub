So I have a question. Let's just say that we need to park a moving truck in front of our new place for a few hours while we unload. So, we go to the police station to get "No Parking" signs 72 hours in advance, just like we're supposed to. We go put up the signs in front of the house and realize that on the day we're moving, the side of the street where we live is already no parking because of street cleaning.

So, my question is this: Is it unethical to just park the truck there, on the restricted side of the street, for as long as it takes to unload? Tuesday was chosen in good faith. That is, we chose the day and then found out that it was street-cleaning day. 

I don't suppose it matters too much whether it's unethical or not, because we're going to do it anyway. But we'd like to not piss off our neighbors (or the police) before we even finish moving in.
