[American Airlines to 'Path to 9/11' Producers: That Was US Airways, You Jackasses - Consumerist](http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/american-airlines/american-airlines-to-path-to-911-producers-that-was-us-airways-you-jackasses-200542.php)

So apparently the farce of a documentary called "Path to 9/11", which seeks to politicize the tragedy even more than it is by spreading lies and deception, got some facts not related to Bill Clinton wrong.  You see, it wasn't American Airlines who let Mohammed Atta through.  It was US Airways. 

> American Airlines are so pissed, they're threatening to withdraw all advertising from the ABC network, and are also murmuring ominously about lawsuits.

I think this is merely karma for American Airlines.  If they hadn't [screwed up my bachelor party](http://www.complainthub.com/?p=66), or if they had [been nice about fixing it](http://www.complainthub.com/?p=90), this never would have happened.
