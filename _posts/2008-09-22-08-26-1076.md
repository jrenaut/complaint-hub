On the bright side, the kid met her great grandmother yesterday. She even behaved herself.  
  
On the other hand, we are going to have to teach her that staying up until 2AM is moderately tolerable on the weekend, but highly frowned upon when Mommy has to take her to the doctor at 8AM the next day and Daddy has to go to work.
