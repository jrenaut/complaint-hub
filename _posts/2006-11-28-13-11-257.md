[ESPN.com - MLB - Pen collection: O's to add Williamson, Bradford](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2678427)

> The Baltimore Sun reported that Bradford, who pitched for the Mets last season, will receive a three-year contract from the Orioles.

Chad Bradford, hero of a chapter in [Moneyball](http://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393057658/sr=8-3/qid=1164726376/ref=pd_bbs_3/104-5540795-4394352?ie=UTF8&s=books), is going to be an Oriole!  This is cool.  Of course, they'll probably pay him way too much, as they usually do.  But at least they didn't [blow $100 million](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2674398&campaign=rss&source=MLBHeadlines) on Carlos Lee.  And the Orioles generally don't run into money problems.

Just like every other year, I get excited about the Orioles in the off-season.  They're finally addressing a real need (the bullpen), and the young rotation could be on the verge of greatness (Or it could be on the verge of going back to the minors).  I guess we'll see.  The Yankees and Red Sox were very beatable last season, so maybe next year we can actually compete.

This is probably all happening because I mentioned to some people that I was seriously considering abandoning the Orioles for the A's because the Orioles haven't been making a sincere effort to get better for years.
