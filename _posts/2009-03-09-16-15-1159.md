[Where Are The Women, Esquire?](http://www.npr.org/blogs/talk/2009/03/where_are_the_women_esquire.html)

> Not good enough, Esquire. So what are you really saying with this list? Either, that women aren't making much of anything you deem essential, or that men can't handle music written and/or performed by women.

Sarah totally ripped off my Facebook comment for that sentence. This got me thinking. I don't listen to a lot of female artists, and I'm not sure why. I like Garbage a lot, and any music collection should contain [Version 2.0](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000006NZV?ie=UTF8&tag=comphub08-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000006NZV)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=comphub08-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000006NZV). The wife is a big fan of [Alanis Morissette's Under Rug Swept](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005TPKC?ie=UTF8&tag=comphub08-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00005TPKC)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=comphub08-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00005TPKC). I had only heard her one big hit record, and if that's all you've heard, try this one, it's like it's by someone else. You know, someone talented. And there are some other female artists who are pretty good, but I just don't listen to them. It's partly because I feel like a traitor to my beliefs every time I think about giving money to a record company. I haven't bought a cd outside of [Nine Inch Nails](http://www.nin.com) in at least two years. I thought about buying a Jill Sobule cd because of how awesome what she did with [her last cd](http://www.jillsnextrecord.com/) was, but I've never knowingly heard a song by her, so I didn't buy the cd. Anyway, if you know a female artist that I absolutely have to hear, let me know in the comments. Whichever sales pitch is best, I will buy that cd. Unless the wife owns it. Bonus points if I can legally obtain the music for free while paying money from something that I can't copy instantly and perfectly. Update to add: I downloaded [the four songs Jill Sobule is currently sharing](http://www.jillsobule.com/showandtell.html) and will listen to them tomorrow at work. Update again to add: Meh to Jill Sobule. I didn't like the songs. I still think she's cool for her business model, though.
