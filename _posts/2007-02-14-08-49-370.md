You know, I'm really kind of excited to move to a place where things like "Who's on the zoning board?" actually interest me. I realize that the decisions of the zoning board, especially in an area like Columbia Heights where tons of new construction is happening, really make a difference.

However, it worries me that people who run for office in the District seem to have legal problems at well above the national average. Maybe it's just Marion Barry throwing off the curve.
