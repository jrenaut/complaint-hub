The wife has been going a little crazy on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com) lately. If she was spending more than $5 at a time, I'd probably intervene, but she's just buying clothes for our daughter, and she's barely spending anything, so I figure it's not a problem. I'll be keeping an eye on her, though. Whenever someone mentions eBay, I invariably get an urge to buy something, because you can buy pretty much anything there. And every time I look at eBay, I end up searching for a nice [Triumph TR6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_TR6) in good condition for a reasonable price. I'm going to own one someday. I'm going to get some money together, buy one, get a one-way plane ticket to wherever it is, and drive it home. It will be glorious. I'll do it when the weather's nice so I don't have to put the top up.
