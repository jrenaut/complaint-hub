We (Myself and four coworkers) went to Ruby Tuesdays for lunch today.  They actually had the same menu as last time, which is a shock.  But they've stopped providing a bottle of ketchup at the table.  Instead, they provide a little bowl.  I just sent them a complaint through their [website](http://www.rubytuesday.com).  Maybe they'll give us something free.  I told them we go there two to three times a month, and we'll go to Fridays or Chilis instead if they don't bring back the bottles.  That's probably an empty threat - Fridays has no parking, and Chilis has terrible service.  But they don't know that.
