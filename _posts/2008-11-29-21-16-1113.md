I hit 50,000 words this afternoon. I kind of like the story. It's not my favorite, but after the last two years of utter garbage, this one is fantastic by comparison. I plan to post it here eventually, but I kind of want to take a break from it, at least until tomorrow, so you'll have to wait if you want to read it. As you see in the picture, I didn't get out of all my parent duties this month. The wife went above and beyond in helping me make time for writing, although she complained a bit. I am indebted to her for a while now. I couldn't have come close to 50,000 if she hadn't helped, and I am very grateful, even though she doesn't believe me when I tell her. I wrote a lot today with the kid in either the Moby wrap pictured, or in her [Lascal M1 Carrier](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VD8BCA?ie=UTF8&tag=comphub08-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000VD8BCA)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=comphub08-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000VD8BCA) after we went for a walk when she wouldn't take a nap this afternoon. I like the M1 better for carrying her for a while because it distributes the weight better, but it's harder to sit down wearing it, so if I hope to come home from the walk and have her stay asleep, the Moby is better. I should get back to posting regularly now that I don't have a novel to write.
