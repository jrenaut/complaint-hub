[Hell.com is being sold at Web domain name auction - Oct. 27, 2006](http://money.cnn.com/2006/10/27/technology/hell.com_domain/index.htm?eref=rss_topstories)

> The online address is the latest to be put up for sale in a growing market for domain names, consisting of Internet addresses people type in for Web sites, which has been fueled by the surge in Internet advertising, the newspaper said.

I don't really care about hell.com - as search engines get better and better, the necessity for a good, memorable domain name goes down.  But the sentence quoted above is really awesome.  It's like saying, "a growing market for houses, consisting of buildings that people live in".  Whoever wrote that sentence doesn't seem to have any understanding at all of what they're talking about.  I mean, if the market for domain names consisted of cuddly little puppies and Elvis memorabilia, would it still be the market for domain names?
