I ran the [Lawyers Have Heart 10K](http://runlhh.org) yesterday. It was much more miserably hot and humid than the weather forecast had suggested. But my time was 56:04, only a minute slower than my previous 10K, which I ran in much cooler weather.

This race was much more crowded than my other one. The first mile was tough - not only were we baking in the sun, but it was like driving in rush hour traffic. There was always a slower person in your way, or a faster person cutting you off. But it cleared up later on.

I wore my flag football jersey in honor of our end-of-the-season cookout later that day. You probably can't read the back of the jersey, but the name is FISTROCK, which is a reference to the [Mystery Science Theater 3000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000) episode that lampooned the movie [Space Mutiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Mutiny). The jersey was cooler before [BLASTBODY](http://stumblingdonkey.com) moved to San Fransisco. But it's still cool. To me, at least.

Anyway, I had one moment during the race when I wasn't sure I was going to finish. Have you ever had one of those where it's quite clear that your internal temperature gauge is just about into the red? When your body sends a little message to your brain saying, "Hey, stupid, if you don't cool us off pretty soon, we're going to shut down." I had less than a mile left, and I was again baking in the sun. But the feeling passed, and I finished the race. It helped that the last quarter mile was in the shade, downhill, with a breeze.
