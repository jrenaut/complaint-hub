I've said many times before that we should stop computing [BMI (Body Mass Index)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index), we should stop basing any sort of judgments on it, and we should just stop even remembering that it exists. It's a terrible measure of health, and it mistakenly classifies all sorts of people as healthy or unhealthy. Well, now I can say the same thing again. But this time with science! [Chad Orzel, physicist and new father,](http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2008/08/fit_trumps_fat.php) says: 

> This will not come as a surprise to anyone who has ever put the stats for their favorite pro athlete into a BMI calculator (you want to tell Michael Strahan he's obese?), but it's nice to see it holds more widely.

He references a [NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/health/19well.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1219147459-neZ+5lFcihT63HbCTYOWPA) that I won't bother to read because, frankly, the NYT gets on my nerves. But it says just what I said above - if you use BMI to judge a person's health, you're going to be wrong much of the time.
