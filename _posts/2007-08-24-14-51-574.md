My new laptop just shipped, and I'm very excited, and compulsively checking the UPS tracking every four seconds.  You know how you can plug a tracking number from UPS, FedEx, USPS, whatever, into Google, and it will take you to the tracking info?  This is hugely helpful, and is one of the things I love about Google.

Anyway, I plugged in the tracking number, and the first result was a link to UPS, as expected.

The second link was to a porn site.  This is absolutely brilliant, and I almost want to go give the porn site some money just to express my admiration.  I'm not going to, though. 

But if you're reading this, penisdance.com, you all are pretty much the best search engine optimizers ever.
