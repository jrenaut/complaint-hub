A bunch of hits on the last post, especially for a Friday night. It looks like people are watching stuff tagged with "Drupal" or "SEO" or something like that. Anyway, at the advice of the commenters, I've replaced trackback with [pingback](http://drupal.org/project/pingback), which requires less (no) effort and still accomplishes that two-way link between me and anyone who happens to link to me. I also tweaked my robots.txt file. So, we'll see what happens. Now I just have to keep writing things that people find interesting. Or, you know, start.
