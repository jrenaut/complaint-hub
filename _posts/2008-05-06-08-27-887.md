A little while back [I sponsored](/node/870) two pages at [Baseball Reference](http://www.baseball-reference.com). It was mostly for fun, and because it's one of my favorite sites on the whole internet, and it's cool to give something back. So I thought I'd give a report on how that sponsorship is going in terms of referrals. My sponsorship of [Mark Knudson](http://www.baseball-reference.com/k/knudsma01.shtml) has resulted in TWO new visits to the site. Since I'm surprised that two people have even looked at Mark Knudson's career stats since April 7th, that seems like a good result. And my sponsorship of [Chad Bradford](http://www.baseball-reference.com/b/bradfch01.shtml) has resulted in FOUR new visits to the site. Bradford's status as an active player having a good year (Small sample size, but he's got a 1.03 WHIP and a 297 ERA+ in 12 innings, can't complain about that) means that he's probably getting more traffic, so it makes sense that he'd drive more people here. To put the traffic in perspective, though, over the same time period, I've had 504 total visits (It's been a slow posting time, so my traffic is down). 27 of those hits are from people Googling "vector security". Five are from "mccain nude". Six are from [outside.in](http://outside.in) and twenty are from [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com). Anyway, I'm certainly not going to quit my day job anytime soon and make a living here. Of course, since I don't sell ads here, paying for traffic is kind of silly, but that wasn't really the point of my sponsorship.
