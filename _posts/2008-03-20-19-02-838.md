As some of you may know, I drive out to Falls Church for work every day. As I go down 14th Street NW in the morning, I look fondly at the bike path, trying to ignore the frequently double-parked cars, right turners, and other obstacles, and imagine biking to work. How smug I would be, getting some exercise, some fresh air, shrinking my carbon footprint. I mean, in terms of yuppie street cred, commutes go something like this, in increasing order of smugness: 

  1. Drive
  2. Carpool
  3. Metro
  4. Long bus ride
  5. Metro from a "sketchy" stop like Brookland or Navy Yard
  6. Telework
  7. Full time grad student (Only if you're at least 4 years older than most of your classmates)
  8. Short bus ride
  9. Walk
  10. Bike
I was thinking, though, how much longer it would take to bike than drive. And then I passed a guy on a bike. I passed him around P St, or maybe T. I thought to myself how it must take him forever to get to work. I wondered if I had that kind of dedication. And then, I got stuck at the light at N St. And he passed me. The light changed, and I nearly caught him, but then he was off as I waited at the light at the circle. I lost track of him after that.
