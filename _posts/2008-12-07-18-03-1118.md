After last year's NFL playoffs, I mentioned that [Tony Romo is a miserable quarterback after December 1st](/ch/734). No one else seems to notice this. But today, he's doing it again (Against a great defense, to be fair). At the end of the first half, he's completed 11 of 21 for 91 yards, two interceptions, and a lost fumble. His rating is about 20. This looks remarkably like every other game he's played in December, and should be terrifying to Dallas fans. Pittsburgh's utter lack of offense today is keeping the Cowboys in the game, but Romo can't give up the ball three times a half and expect to win games. Edit to add: Maybe I spoke too soon. He completed two of three, including a touchdown to Owens, on the first drive of the second half. Edit again to gleefully add: I had given up on this game, watching _Encino Man_ instead, when [a friend](http://www.marketingfinanceobama.com) IMed me to let me know that Romo had thrown a pick-six with the game tied, his third interception and fourth turnover of the game. Nice game, Romo.
