Four hundred and sixty words on the Metro this morning.  Did you see how I wrote out "four hundred and sixty", instead of simply writing "460"?  That is what is called "maximizing your word count for [National Novel Writing Month](http://www.nanowrimo.org)".  There, I did it again.  I could have abbreviated National Novel Writing Month.  Or used apostrophes.  But I did not.

Anyway, that brings my total up to 7,190.  That's a pretty good total for four days plus a commute to work.  And I'm just hitting the first big event in the story.  I don't know the literary term for it.  It's the big event early in the story that enables the rest of the story to happen.  I think it's going well.
