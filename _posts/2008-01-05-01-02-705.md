[Spears hospitalized; loses right to see kids - CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/01/04/britney.spears.ap/index.html)

> A court commissioner Friday gave sole physical and legal custody of the former couple's two little boys to Federline and suspended the troubled pop star's visitation rights.

So the court decided that the genius who is now romantically linked to Paris Hilton is the more qualified parent.  Actually, romantically linked is probably too strong.  They probably got drunk and hooked up.

Anyway, somewhere along the line, someone should have sat Britney down and gave her a little talking-to.  She could have been Madonna's little protege, making obscene amounts of money and doing pretty much whatever she wanted.  Instead, she's a joke who lost custody of her kids.  How often does a judge give custody to the father?  I have no idea what the number is, but it's small.

At the same time, I hope whatever she's been hospitalized for is something they can treat and fix.  Just because she's retarded doesn't mean she should be in the hospital.
