> But I felt that in any country you wouldn't need dialogue to understand the plot. All you needed was a cat and mouse, and everybody knew what was going to happen.

I saw yesterday that he had died, but I didn't post anything about it because I didn't know what to say.  I didn't really know anything about him, but his cartoons were such a big part of everyone's childhood for so many years.  I wonder about the kids I'll have eventually - will they appreciate the things I loved when I was little?  I think it would be cool to watch "Tom and Jerry" with my kids.  You know, in between playing outside and doing their homework and going to museums and family game night and all sorts of constructive behavior.

By the way, the article mentions that "Tom and Jerry" won seven Academy Awards.  That's pretty impressive.
