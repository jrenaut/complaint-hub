Last winter, I applied for the open University of Michigan football head coaching position. I was [rejected](/ch/719). What happened next? "Coach Rich Rodriguez ... guided the Michigan football team to its worst season in its 129-year history in his first year." ([Source](http://detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090101/METRO/901010365)). The wife claims my rejection and Michigan's awful season aren't related, but she's just a girl and doesn't know anything about football (except what I taught her). I'm putting all you big football schools on notice - next time I apply for your open head coaching position, you might want to hire me.
