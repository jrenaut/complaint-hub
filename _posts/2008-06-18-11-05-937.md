Just got back from our final sonogram appointment. The wife's placenta, which was too close to the cervix at the last appointment, has migrated into a perfectly normal spot. Had it not moved, we would have had to schedule a C-section, which we really didn't want. I mean, sure, if it's the choice between C-section and serious danger to mother or child, we'll take the C-section. Anyway, we're both quite pleased. Her more than me, I imagine, since she's the one who would have had her stomach cut open.
