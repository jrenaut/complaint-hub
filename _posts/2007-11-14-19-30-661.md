So, some time this afternoon, [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) stopped the 10,000th spam comment here at Complaint Hub.  I think we should all take a moment and applaud Akismet's efforts.  Way to go, Akismet!

**levitra**, from IP Address 202.105.182.15, decided to ask, "How add your to reds?".  That was the comment.  The link to "levitra's" blog or website was some Ukrainian top level domain name.  I'm sure the site is wonderful and informative.  I imagine they sell cheap pharmaceuticals.

I often wonder why they think that someone will take a comment like that seriously and click on "levitra's" website to find out more.  And then, once there, do they really expect that people will think, "Oh, while I'm here, I should buy prescription medicine from a foreign country without the advice of my doctor!"

Seriously.  At least I didn't have to censor the comment for language.
