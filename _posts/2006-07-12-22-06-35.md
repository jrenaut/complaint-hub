[US wants passenger info before overseas departures - Yahoo! News](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060712/ts_nm/security_airlines_dc)

This article is a little thin on details, but apparently [DHS](http://www.dhs.gov) wants to get a list of all passengers on a plane, plus a bunch of info about them, before any plane in another country leaves the gate bound for the US.  Each passenger must then be cleared by customs before the plane can leave.    


Does anyone really think this makes us safer?  Do we somehow have a list of the names and addresses of every terrorist in the world?  If so, maybe we'd be better served by going to their respective houses and asking them to please stop being terrorists.    


This seems like an excellent way to delay plane departures and make a show of making us safe without actually doing anything.  And there's the added bonus that most of the passengers will blame the airline, not the government.  It's really a stroke of genius by Homeland Security.
