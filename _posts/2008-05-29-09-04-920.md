A couple weeks ago, I started planning a happy hour for the [Columbia Heights Forum](http://www.columbiaheightsnews.org/forum/) because people were starting to argue a bit too much, as people tend to do on forums. I figured it would be more friendly if people met each other in person. So the happy hour was last night at [Wonderland](http://www.thewonderlandballroom.com/), and it was pretty cool. I met a few people I "know" from the forum, and we had some [local blog coverage](http://theheightslife.blogspot.com/2008/05/columbia-heights-forum-mixer-love.html) (The Heights Life has a picture of our group at that link). There was a bit of discussion about making these meetups a little more regular, so we'll see what happens. There are still a few forum regulars I'm dying to meet in person. Edit to add: In the comments to the Heights Life post, there is a discussion EXACTLY like the discussions that prompted me to plan the happy hour in the first place. People get angrier discussing things on the internet because you can't see a person's face, you can't hear the tone of their voice, you can't get the non-verbal cues that tell you what the person is really saying. And it's anonymous - it's much easier to hate someone you don't actually know. So I think it's kind of amusing that the post about the happy hour generated exactly the sort of discussion that the happy hour was supposed to prevent.
