The wife and I were driving from her office in the city to Arlington to take my grandmother on some errands when we passed this new monument, and what looked like a circus or something or other happening at the Pentagon. I didn't know anything about it, but apparently she had heard something about a new monument. So we surmised that this was the dedication ceremony. I have to say that, from 395, the monument is kind of dumb. I mean, it's big and shiny and sharp, and I guess it probably strikes fear in the hearts of terrorists or something. But it's sort of ugly.

But, whatever. Art is subjective, and I'm picky about my art. I'm happy to honor the Air Force, as they've done a great deal to protect my way of life.

Anyway, my real point was that part of the ceremony is an air show. As I was turning off of Spout Run Parkway, we heard a loud plane overhead that turned out to be one of these.![USAF B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber](http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/b2/images/b2_6.jpg) Plainly visible, right overhead through my open sunroof on this sunny and brisk day, a friggin' stealth bomber. I'm not usually one to get all worked up over something like this, but these things [cost $2.2 BILLION each](http://www.cnn.com/US/9903/24/us.kosovo.military/). And, it's a stealth bomber. That's pretty awesome. We saw a few other planes (And heard even more), some that I recognize from video games and whatnot. But the stealth was the highlight.

Anyway, I hope that hotlinking to [airforce-technology.com](http://www.complainthub.com/www.airforce-technology.com) isn't going to cause any problems. At least they aren't likely to [goatse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatse) (Link to worksafe explanation, for those who don't know) me.
