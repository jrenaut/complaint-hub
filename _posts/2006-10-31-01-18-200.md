I know I'm scoring some points with the Coke people because I'm talking about their tea so much, but I have to share the last flavor. We tried the Green Tea flavored Enviga today. The wife liked it. I didn't think it really had any flavor.

This whole Enviga experiment has so far been a huge disappointment. It didn't make me shake uncontrollably or hallucinate or give me a twitch. It didn't taste like used motor oil or dead bugs. Maybe I should ask Craig to send me samples of something that's earlier in the testing process and hasn't been approved by the FDA. I'd like something that makes me think I'm some sort of barnyard fowl, preferably a duck. I could live with thinking I'm a chicken, but I would much rather think I was a duck.

Since this hasn't gone well, I'd like to try an experiment. I complained about Enviga, and three cans showed up in the mail. So, I'd like to tell you all that the new 6-series BMW convertibles are complete junk. They are, without doubt, the worst car I've ever seen on the road. The 6-series BMW convertible is absolute proof that there is no god.

However, if BMW would like me to use my super blogging power to spread the word about the 6-series convertible, I'd like a red one with a manual transmission. No skimping on the options, either.
