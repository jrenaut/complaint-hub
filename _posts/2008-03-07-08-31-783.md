I walked past Columbia Heights' new [Target](http://www.target.com) last night on my way to [Wonderland](http://www.thewonderlandballroom.com). I've never seen so many white kids in the neighborhood. It's like a big magnet. It's good to see people coming to the new stores, but I'm afraid that people are glossing over the problems that still remain. There has apparently been a big spike in crime this past week - muggings at gunpoint in broad daylight and on the Metro, and Target has serious theft problems. I imagine things will calm down a bit, but spring is coming, and with it the yearly crime spike when it gets nice outside. I hope Target and the rest of DCUSA are prepared.
