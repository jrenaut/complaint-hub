[Techdirt: China To Mandate Standardized Phone Chargers](http://techdirt.com/articles/20061219/092747.shtml)

Apparently South Korea did this last year and I didn't notice (Sorry, South Korea), but now China is standardizing its phone chargers.  It is absolutely ridiculous now, when each cell phone requires a different charger.  True, people like Radio Shack sell chargers with interchangeable connectors for different phones, but I can't imagine why these things aren't standardized.  Even within one manufacturer, they aren't standard.  So every time I get a new phone, I need a new charger.  And probably two, so I have one in the car and one in the house.  But, no more.  Now all I have to do is buy Chinese phones and make sure I have USB available everywhere.  I wonder how hard it would be to install USB ports in my car?
