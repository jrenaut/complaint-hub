It looks like it might have been sort of my fault that our wireless disappeared. I may have inadvertently changed the name of my neighbor's network instead of ours. Which wouldn't be possible if Comcast actually set different passwords on the routers. It also shouldn't have happened because I told my computer not to connect to the neighbor's network any more after we got our own, but it apparently didn't get that memo.

It seems to be resolved now. I still have my old modem from Cox cable, so I plugged that in, Comcast activated it, and I'm using my Linksys router like I wanted to originally, and everything seems to be fine.

The quality of our cable tv is still poor, though. I still stand by my statements about Comcast sucking.
