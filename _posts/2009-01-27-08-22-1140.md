I've been having a problem with the power supply on my work laptop, a [Dell](http://www.dell.com/) Precision M2300. Rather than charging my laptop, it will frequently beep at me. This makes it difficult to get much done - I'm a software engineer, and all the code and my dev environment is on this laptop. When the battery goes, there is very little constructive work I can do. So I contacted Dell Pro Support. I believe this is different from what most people get - since my company has a contract with Dell, we get the business-level tech support. And they're pretty amazing. I told him what my problem was and he arranged to have a new one overnighted. Can't ask for much more than that. And his English was perfect. I don't care if companies want to outsource tech support to other countries, but the person who speaks with me needs to speak my language well enough to understand and fix my problem. Anyway, I just had to share. I mean, if I write "good experience with Dell Tech Support", that pretty much guarantees a good Google ranking, right? There can't be more than a dozen results for that . . . Edit to add: Of note - banging the power supply on the floor a bunch of times makes it work again.
