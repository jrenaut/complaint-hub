Salad: The Wife's Signature Salad, spinach with candied pecans, dried cranberries, blue cheese, apple and a delicious honey vinaigrette.

Dinner: Scallops over lemon orzo.

Accompanied by: Bell's Sparkling Ale, a November-only 9% alcohol American Triple.

In the oven: 100% [whole wheat bread](http://www.cooks.com/rec/doc/0,164,148168-246199,00.html), rising and almost ready to bake (NB - I used all 100% whole wheat flour instead of the other two types).

Most of the ingredients are organic. It's very low fat, low sodium, and totally delicious. You thought I was smug about living in the city and taking public transportation to work? You haven't seen us eat dinner.
