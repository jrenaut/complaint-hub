We waited too long to try out the "new" [Rita's Water Ice](http://www.ritasice.com/) in Columbia Heights. Their frozen custard is awesome. It's like ice cream, but creamier. If that doesn't sound awesome to you, you must be either crazy or lactose-intolerant. Or vegan. But probably crazy. As we were walking, the wife and were talking about how nice it is to see so many people out and about. The intersection of 14th and Irving is full of people, all the time. Even a year and a half ago when we moved here there weren't half as many people around. Of course, that was before Target and everything opened. And it doesn't hurt that this is the nicest evening we've had in a while - it's cool and breezy and we've already opened the window in the bedroom in anticipation of sleeping without the air conditioning.
