> "I can say unequivocally in my 22 years I've known Barry Bonds he has never blamed anyone for anything."

So says Gene Orza.  A quick Google search for "barry bonds blame" turns up this: 

> "I'm tired of my kids crying. You wanted me to jump off a bridge, I finally did," Bonds told reporters Tuesday, shortly after returning to training camp. "You finally brought me and my family down. ... So now go pick a different person."

So, maybe Orza was exaggerating a little.  Why do people make statements like that when they must know them to be false?

Anyway, Bonds is a jerk.  I don't care how many home runs he hits or what his career stats look like when he finally retires.  He has made himself the poster child of everything that's wrong with Major League Baseball.  It would make me very happy if he doesn't break Hank Aaron's record because he's in jail for perjury.  That would be too awesome.
