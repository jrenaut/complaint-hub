[Inhabitat » SOLAR DECATHLON 2007: Technische Universität Darmstadt](http://www.inhabitat.com/2007/10/19/solar-decathlon-technische-universitat-darmstadt/)

> Combining the manufacturing expertise of Volkswagen with a stunningly modern design sensibility, the Technische Universität Darmstadt’s wowed the crowds this week at the 2007 Solar Decathlon with their gorgeously innovative Solar Decathlon home.

I'm not exactly sure why I haven't gone down the the [Solar Decathlon](http://www.solardecathlon.org/).  They're announcing the winner today.  Maybe we can stop by on the way to flag football tomorrow.

Anyway, the house I linked above is beautiful.  It looks like a little beach house.  And it's totally solar powered.  Imagine dozens of these set just off a nice clean beach, accessible by foot or bike, and maybe a hybrid bus, but no driveways or street parking.  Maybe there's a few Sunfish pulled up on the sand, and a lost flip flop next to a path paved in crushed shells.

If that doesn't make you nostalgic for your childhood, then I have to ask what the heck you did growing up.
