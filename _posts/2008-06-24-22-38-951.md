I don't remember exactly when I started this blog, but tomorrow is the second anniversary of the [earliest post](/ch/3) still in existence. That's a long time. I wrote a lot more about stuff in the news when I started. Maybe I should go back to that. I had more time at work to find things to write about then. Now I actually have to do work when I'm at work. It's really tough to find time for my hobbies during the day. So, here's to another two years. Or more.
