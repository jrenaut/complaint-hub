[![DSC_8371](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2235/2321315742_5845da1968_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/2321315742/) I ran my third race this morning, the [Saint Patrick's Day 8K](http://www.runwashington.com/other/stpat02list.html), right down Pennsylvania Avenue. Mayor Fenty gave us a brief pep talk before the race, and then ran with us. I didn't actually see him, but he finished well ahead of me, I believe. I'll let you know when they post the results later this afternoon. I'm pretty happy with my race. I don't know my exact time, but the race clock was about 41 minutes. Since I didn't start at the front, my actual time is probably 20 seconds or so less than that. Regardless, my average mile time was under nine minutes for the whole five mile race, which was my goal. Edit: 41:07 was my time. That's 136/386 in my age group, 25-29. Average mile time of 8:17. And I was 738/4045 total, 565/1834 males. Mayor Fenty ran it in 32:20. The wife took some great pictures, one of which you can see here. The rest of the good ones are all up at Flickr. She is, as they say, a real trooper. Race time temperature was barely above freezing, and the wind chill made it feel like it was about 20 F. I have another race coming up in April, the [Race to Stop the Silence](http://stopcsa.org/Race/). This will be my second time running it. It was my first race ever, last year, although they've changed the location. It was downtown on Ohio Drive by the water. Now it's still on the water, but over in Anacostia. Big downgrade, as far as I can tell. But I think the Cherry Blossoms are the same weekend, so that's probably why they moved it.
