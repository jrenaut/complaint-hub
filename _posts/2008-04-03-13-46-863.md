Someone found my site searching for "jason varitek nude". Now, I don't know how Google decided that I'd be a good result for that. This is the first time I've ever used those three words in the same post. I guess I shouldn't complain, since the person who found me that way was a first time visitor. But he or she didn't stay long, so I don't expect I've gained a new reader. Since there are not, nor will there ever be, nude photos of Jason Varitek (Or any member of the McCain family) here, perhaps this is not the right destination for people searching Google for those things. I mean, seriously. My mother and my mother-in-law read this. There are not going to be nude photos of ANYONE at Complaint Hub. Ever. Do you hear me, Google?
