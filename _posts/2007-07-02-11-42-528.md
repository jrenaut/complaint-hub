A friend recently gave me opportunity to discover that if you leave a comment under the name "Balls", you are likely to be marked as spam by WordPress and Akismet.Â  Since I rarely ever see real comments marked as spam, I don't usually watch them very carefully, and your comment is not likely to appear on the site.
