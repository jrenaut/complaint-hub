> One thing it doesn't have, of course, is modern safety technology. Race cars in those days didn't even have seatbelts. It was seen as preferable to be thrown from the car in a crash.

This car has a top speed of 185 miles and hour, and it was "seen as preferable" to exit the vehicle at that speed than to stay inside.  I can't imagine what the car must be like to make people think that.  Perhaps, instead of today's "crumple zones", old race cars had "pointy-spike-impalement zones".  That's the only explanation I can think of.
