Just over twenty-four hours ago, my wife and I had our contract accepted on a shiny new condo on Harvard Street, right in the middle of the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, DC. We should be moved in by the end of next month. We are, obviously, very excited.

So, this blog is a few things. First, it's a test of Typo, blogging software written in Ruby on Rails. I've been meaning to try it, mostly because Ruby is more fun than PHP, which is what Wordpress is written in. This is a trial run for switching all of Complaint Hub over to Ruby.

Second, it's preliminary motivation to get more involved in the community. I'm moving into the city, into a real community, and I don't want to sit around and watch. I want to be a part of my new community, and this is to start the ball rolling.

So, we'll see what happens. I plan to update the layout here and play around and do all sorts of geek stuff. With all of the house-related stuff, I don't know how quickly that will happen, but it will happen.

Anyway, keep watching this space. My next post will be more substantive.
