[John Scalzi on gay marriage in NJ ](http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/004563.html)

> Denying committed same-sex couples the financial and social benefits and privileges given to their married heterosexual counterparts bears no substantial relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose.

John Scalzi has a nice bit on the NJ Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. The above is my favorite line from the quote from the decision. It looks like the Jersey Supreme Court has sent a nice not-so-subtle message that the government is not in the business of spreading homophobia and discrimination. I think "no substantial relationship to legitimate governmental purpose" is a lovely turn of phrase, and I applaud the court.

I'm not so sure I'm happy with their failure to rule on whether you can call it marriage - this is an important issue for many, and not calling it marriage leaves them open to "separate but equal" challenges. But I suppose that leaving some of the decision to legislators is what the whole system is about. Hopefully New Jersey's legislature will work something out that most people can live with.
