It's bad enough that Starbucks coffee tastes burnt. I could get around that by ordering, on my wife's recommendation, the mild instead of the regular. And I can get by the milkshakes passed off as coffee by just making fun of the people who order them (A good general rule - if it takes more than 5 words to order your coffee, not including "please" and "thank you", you're drinking a milkshake). I even got past the first price increase that sent the largest coffee over $2 when you include tax. But now the medium coffee is $2.02, less than six months after the last price increase.

I'm done. No more Starbucks coffee. Tomorrow I'll bring in a coffee mug and start drinking free work coffee.

On an unrelated note, I'm testing out a WordPress tag plugin.  I don't really know what it does, but this is the first post that has tags on it.  Maybe nothing will be visible to you.  Anyway, we'll see.
