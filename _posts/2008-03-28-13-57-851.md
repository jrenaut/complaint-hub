[The Official Site of The Baltimore Orioles: News: Roberts seeks closure on trade front](http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080327&content_id=2461196&vkey=spt2008news&fext=.jsp&c_id=bal)

> "I don't know what the resolution is -- I haven't heard anything except what somebody told me," Roberts said Thursday. "[Andy and I] talked for two minutes here yesterday. 'Highly unlikely' doesn't seem like a resolution to me."

I still think this trade is going to happen. And quotes from Roberts, obviously unhappy that it's not resolved, reinforce my point that he's not going to be on top of his game. No one wants to be strung along, not knowing what city he's going to be in next week. At this point, it's ridiculous not to trade him. Just make the deal already. I think it sucks if he leaves this way, but I don't see how you can salvage much of anything at this point. The whole situation is soured.
