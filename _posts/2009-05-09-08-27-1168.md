The wife and kid and I went to [D'Vines](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dvines-washington) yesterday to get beer for the Celtics game (Probably should have gotten more considering the end result). Out in front of the Columbia Heights Metro were beggars from Greenpeace! While avoiding eye contact as much as possible, the wife and I were secretly thrilled that these organized panhandlers had branched out from the fancy spots like the P St Whole Foods to come to our neighborhood. Of course, now I'd like them to go away. I don't like being accosted for my wallet every time I go near DCUSA.
