[FDA OKs Food From Cloned Animals - washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/28/AR2006122800552.html?nav=rss_email/components)

> Because scientists concluded there is no difference between food from clones and food from other animals, "it would be unlikely that FDA would require labeling in those cases," Sundlof said.

I saw this today on [Accidental Hedonist](http://www.accidentalhedonist.com/index.php/2006/12/28/fda_approves_cloned_food), and now on the Washington Post. The issue here is not safety, or how different or not different clones are from normal animals. The issue is that some people don't like the idea of cloning, and don't want to eat a cloned animal.

Personally, I don't care if the animal was cloned. I don't care if nano-scale assembly robots built my prime rib from individual carbon atoms. I'll eat it either way. But I want to know what I'm eating. Give people the information to choose for themselves, and I'm happy.
