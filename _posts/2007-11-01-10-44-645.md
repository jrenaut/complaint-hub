I wrote 205 words this morning on the Metro.  That's not too many.  Although, it's more words than I've ever written before during my work commute, so that's cool.  It's tough to stand and write, especially since I had my normal bag plus my work laptop this morning.  But I don't usually bring my laptop home, and if it really gets to be a problem, I can probably get a seat most of the time.  I tend to not sit on the Metro that often because I don't really like sharing a seat with strangers, and anyone who gets on the train probably needs the seat at least as much as I do.

But if I'm going to be writing, and it becomes too difficult to do standing, then I'll sit more.  Let those elderly and disabled people stand for a change.  They shouldn't be riding Metro at rush hour anyway.
