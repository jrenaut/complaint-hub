So, the wife is into her third trimester now and is clearly visibly pregnant. She rides the metro from Vienna to Farragut West everyday and then of course back in the afternoon. In the morning she always gets a seat because it's the first stop on the Orange line. In the afternoon of course she has to cram in with a bazillion other people. In the 26 weeks she's been pregnant there have been less than 5 people who have offered to let her take their seat and all of them have been women. Not a single man has offered her their seat! Are guys today really that inconsiderate that they can't offer a pregnant woman or elderly person their seat? I find this unbelievable but sadly expected I guess.
