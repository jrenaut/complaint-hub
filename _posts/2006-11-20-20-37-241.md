199.6 was my weight today, in pounds (That's 90.5 kg, for those of you who use that crazy system), after the gym, with shoes on.  Today is the first day since I don't even know when that I was under 200 pounds fully clothed.  I suspect it may have more to do with two weeks off from the gym and losing muscle rather than losing fat, but I choose not to dwell on that.
