[Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories - Book Review (and build!): Forbidden Lego](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/flego)

> Forbidden Lego written by a pair of Lego master builders, who used to work in designing advanced Lego sets (e.g., Mindstorms). While they obviously got to work on lots of cool things while they were there, there were certain projects that just turned not to be suitable to be made into kits released by the Lego company. They wrote the book to give some kind of a tantalizing hint at the kinds of things that go on behind the scenes at Lego, and the kinds of neat things that might get released in a world without product liability suits.

If you don't want to read the article (Which you should, but I know you're lazy), just watch the YouTube video [linked within](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCZQBjVDzHA).  It's pretty much the best YouTube video ever.  Well, maybe not.  But it won't get stuck in your head like [Chocolate Rain](http://youtube.com/watch?v=EwTZ2xpQwpA).

The book includes instructions on how to make automatic weapons with Legos.  What could possibly be cooler than that?  Anyone not intrigued by a self-loading Lego catapult is no friend of mine.
