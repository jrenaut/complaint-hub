Anyone have the CNN headline widget on their Google homepage? I do. Someone over there has a weird sense of humor, because they like to juxtapose the weirdest articles. Currently, they have these three headlines displayed: 

  * [Strong earthquake rattles Jakarta](http://www.cnn.com/rssclick/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/07/19/indonesia.jakarta.quake/index.html?section=cnn_topstories)
  * [Britain heat could set all-time record](http://www.cnn.com/rssclick/2006/WEATHER/07/18/britain.swelter.reut/index.html?section=cnn_topstories)
  * [John Cusack says he has a stalker](http://www.cnn.com/rssclick/2006/SHOWBIZ/Movies/07/18/cusak.stalker.reut/index.html?section=cnn_topstories)
Which one of these is not like the others?

I mean, sorry, John, I loved [Grosse Pointe Blank](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119229/), but your stalker is not headline news. Good luck with that, though.
