> Summer blood shortage [worse than usual](http://www.nbc4.com/news/13893527/detail.html) (click [here](http://www.givelife.org/) to find donation opportunities).

The wife and I talked about this a little while ago and haven't done anything about it. Maybe after our houseguests (arriving today and Friday, I think) are gone, we'll actually go give blood. Neither of us is really thrilled with the prospect. I gave blood once, during a high school blood drive. I didn't feel faint, I didn't pass out, but the nurse nearly took out the needle. I've never liked thinking about what goes on underneath my skin. It all seems too complicated, and if I think about it, it might stop working. So I like to pretend that I'm solid skin all the way through.

It's not the blood that bothers me. I don't get freaked out at the sight of blood. But while giving blood, I was shaking a bit. I sucked it up and finished, though. And I should do it again. I don't remember my blood type, and I don't think it's one of the rare or really versatile ones, but I'm sure someone can use it.

Anyway, I'm going to give blood.  You should, too.  You really don't need ALL the blood you have.  There's bound to be someone who needs it more.
