I'm back from the race. Official results posted [here](http://www.runwashington.com/results/searchable.html). I was 140th of 216 men. I was 30/47 in my age group, but my age group is 25-29, which is pretty competitive. Five of the top ten, including the top three, were in my age group. I finished in 55:04, first place was 31:27.

So, I'm pretty happy. I would do it again. My toe didn't bother me. The dregs of my cold didn't bother me.

Biggest bother of the day, actually, was the crowds of people for the cherry blossoms. It took us forever to get back home because of all the streets that were closed. If Metro opened a little earlier, I would have done that, but it was cutting it a bit close.

And now the Bay Bridge Run monkey is off my back. A few years ago, some friends and I planned to run it, and we never made it. We started training, and then gave up. But now I've officially done a 10k. Maybe next year I'll be in town for the Bay Bridge Run, and I can do that one. I think it's a tougher run - this one is all flat, but the bridge slopes a lot. Next year.
