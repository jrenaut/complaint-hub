Brandon Fahey got another extra base hit! That gives him two this year, and brings his slugging percentage to a torrid .241. The Orioles almost blew another one to the miserable Royals, allowing two runs in the 9th before closing it out. They're still outperforming their [Pythagorean win expectation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_expectation), although not nearly to the extent that Toronto is missing theirs. But at least they're competitive, which is more than I can say for the Nationals, and more than I expected out of the Orioles this year.
