So, I drive to work less than once a month.  I take the Metro almost all the time, but our corporate office is out in Manassas, and so on the infrequent days I have to go out there, I drive.  Today is the first time since I started at this position in March that I drove to the office where I actually work because I'm going to Manassas a little later today.

Coincidentally, today is the first day of the winter that we're getting snow.  Now, it's just flurries, and shouldn't affect anything, but seriously.  The ONE DAY I drive to work, we get snow.  That's just absurd.  That, I think, is the most convincing evidence of a supreme being that I've ever heard - there must be a god because he/she/it has a sense of humor.

Well, Supreme Being, if it's not too much trouble, can I get some rain on Saturday so our flag football game gets cancelled?  We're really short on players this week (including myself), and it's the first week of playoffs, and I'd really like a rescheduling.
