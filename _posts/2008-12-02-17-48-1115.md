Have you ever been to [Banana Leaves](http://www.mybananaleaves.com/index.html) at Connecticut and Florida NW? I went once when they first opened, and was pleased with the food. The bench seats were freshly varnished and stuck to my jeans, though. They have a pretty goofy website with a little dancing banana gif straight out of 1996, but they also have a pretty neat little online ordering system. It apparently doesn't work too well in Firefox 3 on OSX (The wife's computer, not mine), but it was fine on my work laptop (Firefox 3, XP). I just ordered dinner. I'm waiting for confirmation. The interface is a little bit three years ago, lacking the polish that we've become accustomed to, but it seems to work well. This is fantastic for those of us who would really like to abolish phones. I try not to ever have to talk on the phone. I did have to call them to make sure they deliver to us, although I could have just ordered and waited for them to say no, but that would have taken too much time. We're trying to time delivery with the little Fusspot's eating schedule so that maybe the wife and I can both eat together without a screaming baby. She's been pretty good today, so we're hopeful. I'll let you know how the food is.
