The more I think about it, the more I'm annoyed that I missed the Nationals game today. How often do you see a guy like [Albert Pujols](http://www.baseball-reference.com/p/pujolal01.shtml) walk on to the field as a pinch hitter and hit his 297th career home run? This guy is twenty-eight. His career batting average is .333, OBP .423, SLG .621. If you aren't a baseball fan, you may not understand those numbers. That's okay. They're absurd. If he plays at more or less this level for the next five to ten years, which is what's going to happen unless he gets hurt, he is a first ballot Hall of Famer, the kind of guy you don't even debate. It's just a given. So I'm pretty disappointed that I didn't get to see him. And the Cardinals aren't coming back to DC this season. I'll see him one of these days, though. Next year I get an earlier shot at the company season tickets, so I should be able to pick up a Cardinals game. Now back to the basketball game.
