I just finished rolling over my old 401K from a former employer into an IRA. So now I have a lot more control over what I can do with one chunk of my retirement savings. The question is, what to do? I'm looking for advice, and I'm looking for a good resource to get an overview of investing. I mean, a friend mentioned beaten-down financial sector ETFs. I had to Google "ETF". I don't want to invest in something that I have to Google until I learn a bit more about it. Anyone have advice on a good place to start?
