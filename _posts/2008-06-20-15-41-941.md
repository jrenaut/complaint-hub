[ShysterBall | Cito Gaston's Second Coming](http://shysterball.blogspot.com/2008/06/cito-gastons-second-coming.html)

> Gibbons is out in Toronto. Cito is back!

I hate Cito Gaston. Ever since the 1993 All Star Game, when he picked half the Blue Jays team and didn't put hometown hero (Well, before he jumped ship to the Yankees) Mike Mussina into the game, I've hoped that bad things would happen to him. Not bad like losing a limb or a child or anything like that, but bad like losing an inordinate amount of socks in the dryer, or living next door to a really bad teenage garage band. And now he's back as the manager of the Blue Jays. He was reasonably successful ten to fifteen years ago, but that's a long time ago. Anyway, I wish him the worst possible luck in his continued management career. But, you know, nothing really bad.
