[SI.com - 2006 World Cup - Materazzi admits insulting Zidane but denies 'terrorist' - Tuesday July 11, 2006 12:03PM](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/soccer/specials/world_cup/2006/07/11/bc.eu.spt.soc.wcup.materazzi.zidane.ap/index.html?section=si_topstories)

> "I did insult him, it's true," Materazzi said in Tuesday's _Gazzetta dello Sport_. "But I categorically did not call him a terrorist. I'm not cultured and I don't even know what an Islamic terrorist is."

I wonder - was this quote translated from Italian? Does Materazzi speak English? If he does, how fluently? Regardless, the fact remains that Zidane is a douchebag.
