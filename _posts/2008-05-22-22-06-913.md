The other day [I wrote](/node/899) about how Orioles reliever Jim Johnson picked up a nice hold, then gave up a run before getting lifted. Well, he did it again. The first inning he closed out wasn't dramatic - he got Jeter to line out with a runner on to end the inning in a tie game in the bottom of the eighth. But his second inning was sure dramatic. Single, strikeout, strikeout, walk, and then Robinson Cano singles to win the game. It seems pretty clear from these two games (which is too small a sample size but I don't care) that Johnson should not be allowed to pitch a second inning. Looking at his [gamelogs](http://www.baseball-reference.com/pi/gl.cgi?n1=johnsji04&t=p) on Baseball Reference, this isn't true. It's just the two games that I've noticed where he closed out an inning nicely, then pitched badly when he came out to start the following inning. Anyway, tough loss. Wastes a nice start by Brian Burres. But we're still third, and they're still last. So that's cool.
