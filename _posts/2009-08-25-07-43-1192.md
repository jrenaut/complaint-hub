I still can't believe it. Our Verizon cell phone bill was $19 lower than last month. [The guy who called me](/blog/what-earth-going) was actually telling the truth. Verizon actually called me and lowered my bill. Maybe other companies struggling through the economy these days could take a page out of Verizon's book. Like Citigroup - instead of [adding new fees](http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/174_156/annual_fees_citi_takes_leap-1000998-1.html), maybe try actually helping you customers. Credit cards, like cell phone companies, are largely interchangeable. It's pretty simple for me to switch to AT&T; or to another credit card company. If Citi adds a fee to my card, I'll close the card immediately. But now Verizon has actually given me a reason to stay with them. AT&T;, meanwhile, is [forcing smart phone owners to buy a data plan](http://www.phonescoop.com/news/item.php?n=4733) in the name of better customer satisfaction. And I'll probably spend more money with Verizon soon - when they have a phone with a data plan that meets my requirements, I'll upgrade, and there's another $30 a month or whatever it is. Anyway, thanks, Verizon. This is one of the coolest things a company has ever proactively done for me.
