[Dinner](/blog/dancing-bananas-and-surprising-websites) was so good. I had the Grilled Honey Peanut Tofu with brown rice and the wife had the Malaysia Mee Goreng, and we each had a vegetarian spring roll. The website lets you choose a time for delivery. We chose 7:45, and the delivery guy arrived at 7:43. It's funny, because the first time I heard of them, it was because I found the website, and I made fun of it for being really awful. And in some sense it still is really awful, but at least they spent their time (or, more likely, money) on an online ordering system rather than [gobs of awful Flash](http://www.napoleondc.com/). Well done, [Banana Leaves](http://mybananaleaves.com/). We will definitely be ordering again. Local blogging sensation [Prince of Petworth](http://www.princeofpetworth.com/2008/12/judging-restaurants-banana-leaves/) mentioned Banana Leaves today, too. The commenters there aren't all as positive about the place as I am, but what do they know?
