I was just looking through my Gmail spam folder, which I do from time to time to see if it caught anything it shouldn't have. I'm mostly curious - anything that gets caught in there is probably not worth reading anyway. But one email jumped out at me - someone named Zane Gay (Not the author, that's [Grey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Grey)) sent me an email entitled, "Fondle all her internal nerve endings". Maybe this guy _should_ be an author, because he's got a way with the English language, I'll tell you. Maybe he should be a poet, instead. The rigid constraints of prose could never hold Zane Gay back. I hope someone out there was sitting on his couch, thinking to himself, "Gosh, Jane sure is a great girl. I really want to fondle all her internal nerve endings, but HOW?". And then he happens to look in his inbox and see this gift from Zane Gay. That's the way the world should work.
