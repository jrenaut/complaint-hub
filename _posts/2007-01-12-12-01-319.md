[ESPN.com - MLB - Bonds denies receiving amphetamines from Sweeney](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2728327&campaign=rss&source=MLBHeadlines)

> "He is both my teammate and my friend," Bonds said in a statement. "He did not give me anything whatsoever and has nothing to do with this matter, contrary to recent reports."I want to express my deepest apologies especially to Mark and his family as well as my other teammates, the San Francisco Giants organization and the fans," he said.

After my recent post [bashing Barry Bonds](http://www.complainthub.com/?p=328), I feel some obligation to show the other side, as well - he actually said the right thing for a change.  I obviously can't attest to the sincerity of what he said, but I can at least say that this is the first time I've ever read a quote from him and thought, "Assuming he's sincere, that was the right thing to say."

Of course, you may argue that he wouldn't have had to apologize if he had never a) taken amphetamines or b) blamed an innocent teammate for giving them to him.  And you'd be absolutely right.
