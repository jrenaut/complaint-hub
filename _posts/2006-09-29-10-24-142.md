[Uni Watch » White Glove Treatment](http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2006/09/29/white-glove-treatment/)

Uni Watch is a weirdly fascinating daily blog that obsesses over quirks in professional and college sports uniforms.  I don't know why, but after [Mo](http://www.complainthub.com/Dude clearly needs to get his priorities straight) pointed it out to me, I read it almost every day.  Today's was particularly funny.

I know, as an announcer, it must be hard to come up with interesting banter when nothing interesting is happening on the field.  But I think they can try harder than this.
