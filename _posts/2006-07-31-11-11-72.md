[Nokia's N73 Cellphone With 3.2-megapixel Camera Available Now in Europe - Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/nokias-n73-cellphone-with-32megapixel-camera-available-now-in-europe-190880.php)

A 3.2 megapixel cameraphone with built in [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) support?  That needs to be available here, now.  With a glass Zeiss lens.  Maybe a little zoom and image-stabilization.  And at a reasonable price.  You can keep the MP3 player built in, though.
