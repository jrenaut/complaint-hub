I've gotten into a little discussion on DRM and ebooks over at [Feedbooks](http://blog.feedbooks.com/?p=82). If you're interested in potential business models for authors in a world of infinite goods, hop on over there and join the discussion. Especially if you can contribute more than me (That is, if you can do more than parrot what you read on [Techdirt](http://www.techdirt.com)).
