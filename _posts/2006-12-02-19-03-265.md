It's actually quite a nice day out.  It was a little cold this morning as we lost our flag football game, but it's 47 and sunny now.  Excuse me for a moment . . . Ahh, that's better.  Sorry, just had to take a quick break and drink a little [Bell's Oberon](http://www.bellsbeer.com/branddetail.asp?BrandID=7) that we got from [Whole Foods](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/) just half an hour ago.  We were there trying to find key limes for a pie, but had to settle for regular limes.  Hopefully our hosts this evening won't notice.  The wife will probably tell them.

Anyway, I took a little detour down the beer aisle, because I knew they had Bell's, and wanted to see if they had anything new.  Turns out they did, as they did not have Oberon last time.  It's out of season now, so this is maybe the dregs of the summer run, but, contrary to what Budweiser might tell you, beer doesn't have to be bottled in the last week to taste good.  And honestly, lukewarm skunked Oberon is better than freshly bottle Budweiser anyway.

So we picked up a little sushi, and a little Bell's, and even a new flavor of [Odwalla](http://www.odwalla.com/index.asp) bar.  It's so new it's not even on their website yet.  It's called Choco-Walla, and I haven't tried one yet, but it's sure to be delicious.

[The cat](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetejon/79471082/) is currently trying to drink my beer.  I might have to lock her in a closet.
