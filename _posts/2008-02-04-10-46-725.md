Nothing ever happens in sports the way I think it will, or think it should.  I didn't really want the Patriots to win, but I would only root for the Giants if they were playing the Cowboys, and even then it's not a guarantee.

And giving the MVP award to Eli was just stupid.  He had a bad game, then a good fourth quarter, assisted in large part by an absolutely spectacular catch by David Tyree.  But the difference in this game was the Giants D-Line, and I would have given the MVP to Justin Tuck, with his five tackles, two sacks, and a forced fumble.

The Patriots offensive line, great all season, looked terrible yesterday.  And thus it follows that Tom Brady looked terrible, which as usual will remind no one how dependent a quarterback is on his offensive line.

Anyway, I can't wait for the next few months of Eli Manning talk.  That's going to be awesome.  At least Shockey was hurt.  That's the one bright spot here - the Giants went on their playoff run without that clown.
