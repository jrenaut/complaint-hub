We just finished round one of setting up the baby's room. Pictures are [here](http://flickr.com/photos/thetejon/sets/72157606407660791/). We had "Before" pictures, as well, but we're having memory card problems. Hopefully we'll recover them eventually. The wife did a ton of work on this. I did some work, but, as usual, she did the bulk of it. The dresser is mine, which we recently replaced. It came with bunk beds my grandmother bought for me when I was 10 years old or so. We painted it with leftover paint from the rest of the house, and it looks pretty awesome (Even better in person). The room is pretty awesome. It's loud and vibrant, and gender-neutral without being pastel green and yellow. We've moved the futon out into the sun room. I'm not sure how we'll like it there. So far the cat seems okay with it, so there's that. And I'm not sure how houseguests will like it. We've had tons of people stay with us since we moved in, and now we don't have a guest room anymore. Only six weeks or so, and the baby will be here. And now it has a place to sleep.
