[Whatever: When Ministers Say Goddamned Stupid Things](http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/004335.html)

John Scalzi has a little response to Reverend Dr. Bill Lawson, who compared Ken Lay to Martin Luther King, Jr, and to Jesus. This is worse than [PTI](http://sports.espn.go.com/espntv/espnShow?showID=EOPT) comparing Jonathan Papelbon to Mariano Rivera.

By the way, if you're a fan of science fiction, or even if you aren't, check out Scalzi's books. I've enjoyed them. His blog's not bad, either.
