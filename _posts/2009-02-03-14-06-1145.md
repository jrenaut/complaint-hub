I got a call a few minutes ago from my credit card company, which at one time was First USA. I think it still is. Anyway, the CSR told me that someone had tried to make a charge on my card, and it looked like fraud. Sure enough, I didn't recognize the charge. I finished with her without giving any information - never give out information, even your home address, to someone who calls you. You have no idea who they really are, even if your caller ID tells you it's the person you think it is. I called the number on the back of my card, and sure enough, the first call was legitimate. I suspected it was - she knew about two real charges I made yesterday and one this morning - but I'm glad I checked. A few more minutes and the card is on hold and my new card is on the way. It's a bit of a nuisance, but I'm really impressed with the service. It is mildly annoying that my online account access is disabled until the new card is activated, so I can't check to make sure there weren't other bad charges, and I can't go back and make sure I remember any regular bills that get paid on the card, but in a few days I'll have my new card and I'll be able to get back in. It's always nice to be pleasantly surprised by your credit card company. Too bad it doesn't happen more often.
