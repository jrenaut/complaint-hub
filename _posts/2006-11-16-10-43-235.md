[D.C. Moves to Become Pioneer In Forcing 'Green' Construction - washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR2006111501624.html?nav=rss_email/components)

> The era of "green buildings" would include devices such as low-flow shower heads and recycled materials and would require designing passageways that encourage walking, choosing drought-tolerant plants and improving air quality by reducing the need for artificial heating and cooling.

I'm very much on board with getting companies to build greener.  And this not only promotes recycling, but health, too, with better air quality and getting people to walk.  My one problem here is that they're forcing companies to do it.  I'd rather see them give incentives first, and if not enough companies do it, then think about legislating it.  For example, if you give tax breaks for meeting some or all of these standards, something to offset the increased cost, then you'll likely get more support from the business community.

As it is, they're kind of salty because they think it will raise costs by 11%, instead of the 2-4% that supporters claim.  But DC is pioneering this sort of program in a large city.  Maybe the next city to try it will go a different route.
