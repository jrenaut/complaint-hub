[Treehugger: Change a Light Bulb: It Really Can Make a Difference](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/06/change_a_light.php)

Treehugger points to a report from the International Energy Agency that claims that switching to efficient bulbs like [CFL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_fluorescent_lamp)'s would cut the world's electricity use by 10%.  Considering that these bulbs are not much more expensive than regular bulbs anymore, and they pay for themselves by using less energy and lasting longer, there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't switch.  Most of them don't work with dimmers, but I think you can get dimmable ones, and if you can't now, you will be able to soon.  I've been switching over at home as bulbs burn out, and my only complaint is that the bulb they say replaces a 60 watt regular bulb is not as bright as a regular 60 watt bulb.
